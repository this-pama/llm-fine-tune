(Please answer in specific terms: \"Our challenge is that...”.)\nOur challenge is that digital agricultural solutions are not effectively diffused in local contexts, limiting their impact on smallholder farmers. We need to understand what digital solutions exist, what digital skills farmers require, and how e-commerce platforms can enhance market access. Many digital solutions are developed without sufficient localization, making them less effective in specific farming communities\n\nBackground: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\nDigital innovation in agriculture holds the potential to improve productivity, sustainability, and resilience. However, many solutions remain underutilized by smallholder farmers due to gaps in digital literacy, access to technology, and contextual relevance. Large-scale producers often have better access to these solutions, creating disparities. Additionally, local e-commerce platforms remain underdeveloped, limiting market access for farmers. Addressing these gaps is crucial to ensuring inclusive agricultural transformation.\n\nThere are some interesting analysis completed by Metamorphosis:", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Unlocking Digital Agriculture - What can we learn from the solutions?", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1824}}

This collaboration seeks to transform waste management in five public markets using circular economy principles, while also promoting inclusive governance, innovation, and behavior change.\nThe initiative strategically integrates a portfolio of experiments across different intervention areas to collectively test what works in building a sustainable model. These experiments include: testing composting models, piloting food rescue programs, activating placemaking for behavior change, co-developing a digital dashboard system for waste management, and launching communication campaigns for environmental awareness. Each experiment is designed to feed learning and adaptation into the others, allowing for real-time iteration and systemic integration.\nThe initiative is grounded in multi-actor coordination involving local government (Dirección de Mercados Municipales), civil society (Fundación Rescate de Alimentos), academia (Smithsonian Institute), and the private sector (Bliss). It aims to reduce organic waste sent to landfills, improve food security, generate compost, and activate markets as sustainable public spaces.

In this new Action Plan, we focus on a deeper understanding of the feasibility procedure and on piloting a concrete solution.  \n\nThe framing of our current challenge emerged from our previous efforts with the Water Commission to enhance the process for evaluating new water service connections in Querétaro. While the current feasibility analysis provides valuable information, several areas of opportunity for improving the analysis have been identified. Estimating water availability and future demand remains complex due to fragmented and outdated data, limited analytical tools, and coordination challenges across departments and institutions. Additionally, the ability to anticipate and respond to climate variability is constrained by the absence of integrated scenario planning tools. Internally, information silos and the lack of standardized mechanisms for data sharing can delay decision-making. These conditions contribute to a reactive planning environment, instead of a more strategic future-oriented one.\n\nWater scarcity is a big issue in Mexico, including the state of Queretaro. Regarding the total territory in the state of Queretaro, the percentages of areas affected by a particular type of drought are distributed as follows, as shown in the image of the map of Mexico:\n\n0.0% Unaffected\n\n3.8% D0 Abnormally dry\n\n17.6% D1 Moderate drought\n\n15.3% D2 Severe drought\n\n27.2% D3 Extreme drought\n\n36.1% D4 Exceptional drought\n\nThis means that a bit more than 60% of the state suffer from the highest types of droughts as of June 2024.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Learning by Testing: Generative AI for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1951}}

These numbers show the vulnerability of the state with regards to access to water, illustrating the urgency of tackling this challenge. [1]\n\nAccording to the Water Information System Monitoring of Mexico’s Major Dams, as of July 2024, Queretaro has 7 damns, 4 of them have reservoir levels of less than 10%, 2 damns have between 11 and 15% and only 1 has a reservoir level of 90%. [2]\n\nWater scarcity in Queretaro has been exacerbated by population growth and an increase in housing. Queretaro stands out due to its economic and industrial development, ranking 5th place on a national level in terms of competitiveness [3]. Due to the competitive job market in the state, in the past years, many people have settled in Queretaro.\n\nComparing the Population and Housing Census of 2010 with that of 2020, the number of households increased by 63.45%, and the population by 47.9%. The number of households increased to a greater extent. One house was built for every 2.37 inhabitants, as shown in the image with the visualization of statistics. [4]\n\nAccording to the 2022 National Survey of Household Income and Expenditures (ENIGH), 68.22% of the population in Queretaro has access to piped water and sanitation, and 68.46% have access to safely sourced drinking water and sanitation services.\n\nIn this context of water scarcity, population growth and urban development, it is important to address the issue of granting feasibilities for new connections to the hydraulic network in a more sustainable way and based on long-term planning.\n\nSources: \n\n[1]https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/tools/DATA/Climatolog%C3%ADa/Sequ%C3%ADa/Monitor%20de%20sequ%C3%ADa%20en%20M%C3%A9xico/Seguimiento%20de%20Sequ%C3%ADa/MSM20240630.pdf\n\n[2] https://sinav30.conagua.gob.mx:8080/Presas/", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Learning by Testing: Generative AI for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1965}}

We share the signals we identified below.\n\nA)    SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES\n\nDams are alarmingly empty:\n\nDue to the water crisis, Queretaro has become the third state in the country with the most dams that do not exceed 30% of their capacity. Back in May 2024, it was reported that  El Centenario, La Llave, and La Venta dams were completely empty [1].\n\nTwo of the other four dams in the region barely exceeded this, as they were holding less than 5% of their total capacity.\n\nThis signal illustrates the urgency of contributing to the management of water resources in the state.\n\nThe privatization of water:\n\nThere are 23 concessions granted by the State Water Commission of Queretaro to private companies, including real estate firms for urban housing and commercial developments. Among the main concessionaires are Operadora Querétaro Moderno and Fraccionamientos Selectos I. This situation leads to discontent among the population, many of them complain about excessive prices in the water service [2] [3].\n\nThis highlights the dynamics of water in the state between private and public sectors, inviting us to think how the feasibilities process could contribute to a better planning of water resources in the future, and better decision making when it comes to deciding if the provision of water should be a private or public enterprise.\n\nThe impact of water scarcity in productive activities:", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Learning by Testing: Generative AI for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1758}}

Aquaculture producers blame low water levels for limiting fish farming. Aquaculturists in the region point out that several of their colleagues have migrated to the United States due to the income drop caused by these conditions.\n\nAdditionally, agricultural and livestock producers have also experienced reduced production due to low reservoir levels. Even if it rains, there is inadequate infrastructure for water capturing. [4] [5]\n\nThis situation showcases how various sectors are being affected by the water crisis and invites us to think how the feasibility procedure for new water connections for housing and commercial use could be managed in a more sustainable way in order to ensure access to water in the future not only for new constructions, but also for productive activities.\n\nAnother signal that illustrates this situation is related to the fact that Queretaro has become a hub for investment with the arrival of several data centers. However, it is anticipated that in the long term, energy demands may not be met. This is exacerbated by bureaucratic procedures, as companies often lack information about how the energy they use is generated. And in addition to energy, access to water to operate the data centers will also put great pressure on the water resources of the state.\n\nSocial response to government’s actions around water management:\n\nGrassroots organizations and indigenous collectives in the region are actively involved in addressing various issues, which are highlighted below:", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Learning by Testing: Generative AI for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_chars": 1689}}

The Indigenous Council of Santiago Mexquititlán \"also commemorated their own struggle, which began on March 31, 2021, against what they described as an attempt to dispossess their community of their well with water pipes owned by a private companies protected by state police,\" expressing concerns about the management of a well by the State’s Water Commission, which they affirm was built by their ancestors [7].\n\nThe examples presented above show some of the dynamics and challenges that surround the management of water resources and its linkage with land use. This highlights the involvement of various sectors in the issue, which invites us to think about possible links with their involvement in the creation of a feasibilities procedure focused on planning.\n\nB)    USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Learning by Testing: Generative AI for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_chars": 1685}}

And while the examples are relatively new and scarce, this technology has the potential to enhance —and even transform— the way governments operate. As shown in the image, some of the trends of using generative AI include improve speed and efficiency of public services and engagement, optimize employee time by reducing manual processes, draw insights to empower decision-makers, etc. [8].\n\nOn the other hand, the huge impact that AI systems can have in various domains of our lives call for a critical, thoughtful, imaginative and cautious approach to designing AI strategies.\n\nAs Vaugh Tan frames it: “To have good AI strategy, we need to make reasoned decisions about:\n\n1.     What humans can do which AI systems cannot — these are tasks which should be done by humans.\n\n2.     What AI systems can do much better than humans — these are tasks which AI systems should be built to do.” [9]\n\nThis becomes particularly urgent in the context of public services because these systems need to ensure human-rights, inclusion, ethics, transparency. Thus, it becomes imperative that we define pathways to design good AI strategies for deploying these systems in the public sector.\n\nSources:\n\n[1] https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/Principales-presas-de-Queretaro-estan-a-3.1-de-almacenamiento-20240514-0057.html\n\n[2] https://www.jornada.com.mx/noticia/2024/01/26/estados/oligopolio-del-agua-socio-de-inmobiliarias-en-queretaro-3791\n\n[3] https://tribunadequeretaro.com/informacion/investigaciones/ley-de-aguas-dan-concesion-disfrazada-corregidora-ya-serian-23-en-queretaro/\n\n[4] https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/Productores-agropecuarios-de-Queretaro-alertan-por-grave-crisis-de-sequia-y-escasez-de-agua-20240311-0083.html", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Learning by Testing: Generative AI for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning", "chunk_index": 6, "chunk_chars": 1882}}

Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?\nThe Accelerator Lab adds unique value by operating in a practice-oriented, experimental mode—designing and testing proof-of-concept solutions in real-world conditions. Building on prior systemic analysis, the Lab will apply agile methodologies to prototype a AI tool and generate rapid learnings to inform future iterations. This approach enables low-risk exploration of innovative pathways and supports public institutions in making more informed, data-driven decisions.\n\n At the same time, the Lab’s convening power and participatory methods foster collaboration across institutional and sectoral boundaries. In a context where UNDP Mexico is still building its profile in AI and digitalization, this work positions the Country Office as a credible partner for inclusive and sustainable tech adoption. The Lab’s connection to a global learning network further amplifies its impact, allowing it to share insights and draw from international experiences.\n\nShort “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Learning by Testing: Generative AI for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning", "chunk_index": 7, "chunk_chars": 1908}}

Estas interacciones se desarrollaron en espacios de encuentro presenciales en los que los solucionadores (as) presentaron sus propuestas y sus historias de vida, para conectar de manera genuina con el ecosistema de innovación de cada uno de los departamentos. De esta experiencia se cuenta entonces con la articulación que actualmente se está gestionando con instancias como: \n\n-Ministerio de Agricultura- Dirección de Mujer Rural: Al presentar a este ministerio el trabajo realizado desde Mapeo de Soluciones en el departamento de Cauca y Meta, se acordaron las siguientes acciones : \n\n- Participación activa del Ministerio de Agricultura en la Comunidad de Mapeo de Soluciones, desde la aplicación de la oferta institucional con la Federación de Campesinos del Cauca.

(Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) \nWe worked with government and the Barbados Museum &amp; Historical Society on hosting the A.I. Symposium on Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage. Based on this event which included 6 panels of subject matter experts, we gathered the following insights:\n\n1) The Double-Edged Sword of A.I.\n\nSeveral panelists noted the many benefits that A.I. can bring to the Orange Economy in the Caribbean, including democratizing access to cultural heritage, enhancing arts education capacities and opening new markets for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Many of these positive shifts are already being seen, even if on a small scale. On the flipside, numerous risks were noted - with the potential for A.I. to exacerbate inequalities, further entrench biases, and threaten cultural diversity. From a security standpoint, ethical concerns around data use, privacy, and intellectual property were frequently raised. This resulted in a double-edged sword dynamic requiring proper stewardship to ensure the safe usage of A.I. for creative purposes. \n\n2) Ethics, Equity and Human Rights", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy: Closure", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1317}}

Summarize: 'Action goal:', 'Planned steps / timeline:', 'Resources needed / actors:', 'Outcomes achieved (if noted):', 'Lessons learned:', and 'Follow-up actions / monitoring suggestions:'.", "input": "Source file: action_plan_platform.csv\nTitle: Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy: Closure\n\nDocument:\nMany emphasized that any application of A.I. in the arts sector should be firmly rooted in an ethical framework based on human dignity, cultural specificity, and inclusivity. This included calls for a transparent, fair and rights-based approach to A.I. regulation. Additionally, given that A.I. tools are often consumed rather than produced in the Caribbean, it was recognized that A.I. must be anchored in local values rather than those imported externally from global tech hubs. This reflects the reality that dominant A.I. systems typically include Western biases and exclude Caribbean perspectives. As such, there is a need to train A.I. on regional data while also making efforts to protect that data from misuse.\n\n3) Governance Gaps and the Demand for Regional Strategy\n\nIn Barbados and among the wider Caribbean, A.I. policies are under development, especially when it comes to the creative industries where issues such as deepfakes, voice cloning and unauthorized use of likenesses are prevalent. In this process, there is the distinct challenge of keeping up with the fast speed of A.I. technologies, which are constantly evolving. To address this nascent governance field, regional collaboration was recommended with emphasis on solutions co-designed with grassroots communities, artists, technologists and policymakers alongside institutions such as UNDP, BMHS and ICOM as key partners. This Caribbean-wide approach could together address A.I. policy, digital infrastructure and cultural preservation.\n\n4) A.I. and the Orange Economy", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy: Closure", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1544}}

Several artists underscored the importance of understanding digital ownership, authorship and authentication in the age of A.I., resulting in a strong demand for digital rights and policies that prioritize creators. Additionally, fair compensation for creatives was mentioned and tied to the devaluation of art forms that could occur through A.I., as well as the risks of job displacement posed by emerging tools in graphic design, sound production and editing.\n\n5) Education and Digital Capacity Building  \n\nThe Government of Barbados is integrating digital capacity-building efforts into the classroom, seen in coding, digital literacy and civics in the curriculum. These efforts are ultimately preparing students for a future deeply impacted by A.I. At the same time, arts education is focusing on critical thinking, responsible technology use and empowering youth to be active creators rather than passive consumers. This also connects to instilling a sense of integrity and ownership among art producers in the A.I. landscape.\n\n6) A.I. and Heritage Preservation\n\nGlobally in the heritage field, A.I. is being used to digitize heritage-based archives, enhance metadata creation and support conservation. The digitization of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), which includes language, rituals, crafts and oral traditions, is a bit more complex, however, as these elements are harder to digitize and protect. Panelists found that A.I. can help document ICH, but that the fundamentals of trust, consent and cultural sensitivity must be established first. To best future-proof these efforts, the significance of open-source tools, distributed storage and non-proprietary formats for sustainability purposes were voiced.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy: Closure", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1974}}

Concerns around automated harassment, surveillance, and data exploitation were raised. To mitigate these potential pitfalls, panelists recommended intersectionality, community-led safeguards and inclusive data practices in A.I. \n\n8) A.I. in Archaeology &amp; Heritage Preservation\n\nIn archaeology, history is meeting modern technology through applications of A.I. to geophysical surveys, predictive modeling and 3D reconstructions of archaeological sites. This presents valuable inroads to repatriation, education, and cultural storytelling. Still, worries about data ownership, community consent and digital colonialism were expressed as worthy of greater attention and investigation.\n\n9) Call to Action: Local Innovation &amp; Collaboration  \n\nResoundingly heard throughout the panels was a call for the Caribbean to get involved in developing its own A.I. tools while training local talent and shaping global technology narratives. To do so, a push was made for collaboration across sectors, merging government, academia, civil society and creatives together. Overall, A.I. was deemed a transformative opportunity if approached with care, equity, and strategic vision.\n\nConsidering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process?

While we are still in the early stages of implementation, there is growing momentum and enthusiasm across sectors. A diverse group of stakeholders, including government institutions, civil society, academia, and the private sector, are increasingly curious about exploring AI’s potential.\n\nHowever, challenges such as limited technical capacity, fragmented initiatives, and the absence of a unified national strategy still persist. These gaps can slow progress and risk uneven benefits. Nevertheless, the current landscape presents an opportunity to co-create a shared vision for AI that is locally grounded and globally informed, ensuring that innovation contributes to sustainable development and leaves no one behind.\n\nIn Peru, 57% of workers now use artificial intelligence in their daily tasks—an increase of 8 percentage points compared to 2024, when 49% reported using it. This positions Peru as a regional leader in AI adoption, ahead of Argentina and Chile (both at 55%), Panama (40%), and Ecuador (39%). Additionally, 99% of Peruvian workers consider AI useful or very useful in their daily work, reflecting a strong cultural readiness for AI integration.\n\nhttps://gestion.pe/tecnologia/crece-uso-de-ia-en-el-peru-el-57-la-emplea-en-sus-tareas-laborales-diarias-noticia/#google_vignette", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "AI for Inclusive Voice and Participation", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1403}}

Institutions are becoming increasingly aware of their limited capacity to apply AI effectively, particularly in the realm of public governance. At the same time, youth-focused initiatives are emerging to strengthen critical thinking in digital environments shaped by generative AI, misinformation, and algorithmic influence. Meanwhile, experts are raising concerns that AI could deepen polarization and erode democratic trust, especially in fragile democracies like Peru, where electoral processes remain vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nValue proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge?

However, policymaking in the digital sector is seemingly occurring in silos, with limited coordination between parallel efforts. For instance, the development of several strategies appear to have proceeded without explicit directives for alignment or coordination across agencies/sectors. There is limited evidence of unified strategy-setting or a coordinated push to drive digital transformation across sectors, which could adversely affect achievement of government’s envisioned objective.

Due to the lack of overarching government services architecture and no clear definition of who will develop core and common services that can be (re)used by all other systems, it appears that many different government organizations are procuring and implementing very similar systems, often developing software components that have already been developed elsewhere. This is likely highly economically inefficient. More importantly, the lack of interoperability standards, data standards, and other technical standards means these systems will not easily share data or communicate with each other. As a result, a ‘government-wide’ service orientation is missed, compounding the economic inefficiencies.  \n\nIn 2024 UNDP worked with NCIT and President’s office to conduct a comprehensive situation analysis of digital transformation in Maldives. The assessment covered 5 pillars of UNDP’s digital transformation framework and was drafted based on wide consultations with government, private sector, civil society and other stakeholders. The government was involved in the process and the findings of the report were shared with partner agencies with the intention that UNDP will work with government to formulate a national digital transformation strategy.  However, the response and willingness from government mandate holder has been limited. Given the challenges engaging government on strategy development, UNDP has decided to work with the Think Tank who conducted the assessment to put forth recommendations to the government and execute a communication and advocacy campaign with the aim of influencing the digital transformation policy in the country.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Inclusive Digital transformation ", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_chars": 1742}}

This degradation threatens rural livelihoods, biodiversity, and national climate goals, particularly since livestock emissions comprise a major part of Mongolia’s GHG reduction commitments. Despite interest in green finance, the lack of credible, standardized data on rangeland health and carbon impacts hampers progress. Current data systems are centralized, slow, and costly, with limited integration of local knowledge. The challenge involves multiple stakeholders—herders, policymakers, and financial institutions—and produces undesired effects such as weak climate finance readiness, poor land management decisions, and limited access to voluntary carbon markets.

Placing a strong focus on capacity building, we have followed the path of several iterating learning loops during these first 5 years, having generated both impact and key lessons for the development of policies for public innovation.\n\n# Public innovation: from public sector innovation to a national system of public innovation", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "2025_Capacities for Social and Public Innovation", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1503}}

In turn, public goods such as these services can reduce vulnerabilities and turn back the dial on inequalities, a key factor of democratic backsliding as shown by the 2023/2024 Human Development Report “Breaking the gridlock” and the 2024 UNDP Trends Report “The Landscape of Development”. As inequality rises, the strength of democracy falls, leading to a pressing social scenario where most of the half of the world population are supporting leaders that erode democracy. Public innovation, therefore, is an enabler in the path toward stopping democratic backsliding.\n\nAt the same time, the public sector is facing new challenges with the arrival of frontier technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), both in its internal and external relations and outcomes. The opportunities and risks that come with AI make the need to innovate even more relevant: to seize the potential of AI for good while mitigating its dangers, public innovation needs to emerge in the institutional, social, and technological dimensions of our public services and policies, to improve the quality of their outcomes and to respond to the contemporary problems of the citizens, including the need for a better and more direct relation and participation.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "2025_Capacities for Social and Public Innovation", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1700}}

Another key ally is the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), who has committed significant financial resources to carry out the capacity building programs that will strengthen scientific capacity, as well as directly supporting different forms of innovation. By asking how we can develop capacities for innovation in the public sector, we engaged with these allies in a continuous learning journey which is now entering its fifth year. In each new learning cycle, new lessons emerged about how to build capacities for research, development and innovation in the public sector, and its key supporting organizations. We first helped ENI identify the key national innovation challenges that today orient public policies such as the Science, Technology, and Innovation Agenda of CONACYT (https://www.conacyt.gov.py/documentos-agenda-nacional-ciencia-tecnologia-innovacion). As the pandemic ensued, our learning turn to how we can articulate the national innovation system toward one of those challenges, which was already aligned to the challenge increasing resilience against pandemics (https://www.conacyt.gov.py/presentaron-plataforma-innovadora-para-fortalecer-iniciativas-emprendedores). Articulation opened the opportunity to apply our R&amp;D+i methods to specific challenges within this bigger one in 2021, through Wendá (https://wenda.org.py/).\n\nAs a result of this alliance, the Public Innovators Program was born in 2022. The Program builds capacities in public officials from several national institutions through hands-on training, mentoring, and the development of innovation pilots. During its first three editions, the Program trained over 150 public officials and supported the implementation and evaluation of 16 public innovation pilots.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "2025_Capacities for Social and Public Innovation", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1997}}

Although the macro-economic is stable, the inequalities are increasing, affecting also the citizen trust and satisfaction with the government. Better public policies and services are key to stop this trendEspecially because levels of trust between citizens is high, which is an asset for solutions to rise through co-creation.\n\nThe challenges of a more sustainable energy transition represent an ideal opportunity to put both putlic and social innovation at work.

It also creates a safe space to learn from failure and adapt solutions based on what works in practice.\n\nTogether, these methods will not only build capacities in innovation, but also generate actionable insights on how these capacities can become sustained practices ultimately leading to improved public services and community-led solutions for sustainable development.\n\nClick to see options\ndatasources: insights from co-creation workshops", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "2025_Capacities for Social and Public Innovation", "chunk_index": 8, "chunk_chars": 1975}}

The site includes historic monuments, and there are efforts to preserve and enhance the heritage, with the potential to make it a key tourist destination. Historical evidence reveals a direct connection between early African-American families and records of enslaved individuals who trace their origins to Angola. Massangano was an important departure point for those who were taken to the Americas. In 1619, the first Africans from Angola arrived on the shores of Hampton Roads. It is estimated that over 12 million Americans in the United States are of Angolan descent. The Tucker family is descended from the first Africans enslaved in North America.

It also highlights a growing internal demand within UNDP and among its partners for capacity building, practical tools, and long-term digital strategies.\n\nOur current challenge is to connect, scale, and consolidate these efforts, moving beyond promising pilots toward sustainable, people-centered digital ecosystems.\n\nDespite our commitment to digital transformation, significant gaps in digital capacity remain across the Country Office and public sector partners. The UNDP Digital Strategy 2022–2025 notes that most staff lack systematic training in coredigital skills, limiting our ability to support national efforts. This isespecially evident in areas like AI, blockchain, and user-centered digital design. As a result, many innovation initiatives stall due to limited technical follow-up. At the same time, rising internal demand for digital expertise highlights both growing awareness and the urgent need for structured capacity-building.\n\nIn the Argentine public sector, structural and systemic challenges are also reflected in quantitative evidence. A 2024 study by CIPPEC, which assessed the digital maturity of municipal governments across 23 provincial capitals, reported an average overall score of 0.55 (on a scale from 0 to 1) for digital public", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Transformación digital: de arriba hacia abajo y de abajo hacia arriba", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1405}}

While usability and transactional functionality received relatively higher scores—0.62 and 0.69 respectively—the average for data governance was markedly low, at just 0.34. This highlights the critical underdevelopment of strategic data management practices at the local level. The study also revealed that only two-thirds of the municipalities surveyed had established any kind of local regulatory framework for digital policy. The remaining third operated under provincial or national laws, lacking local norms to guide key areas such as artificial intelligence, data ethics, or open data strategy.\n\nAt the national level, the scale of fragmentation is equally pronounced. In 2019, the Auditor General’s Office (AGN) reported that Argentina’s federal public administration was operating with 2,781 distinct IT systems across ministries and agencies. This level of technological disintegration significantly limits interoperability, causes duplication of data and effort, and hampers both service delivery and monitoring. The shortage of technical talent further compounds these challenges. Many municipalities report chronic difficulties in recruiting and retaining professionals with expertise in areas such as programming, data analysis, and digital infrastructure. Public sector salaries are often uncompetitive, and structured training or upskilling opportunities for existing staff are scarce. Although some local governments have started to build informal partnerships with universities and tech organizations, these remain isolated efforts rather than part of a coherent national strategy.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Transformación digital: de arriba hacia abajo y de abajo hacia arriba", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_chars": 1608}}

This Action Plan is built precisely to respond to these limitations, working to close capacity gaps through a combination of internal development, strategic partnerships, and context-sensitive, people-centered innovation.\n\nIn addition to quantitative indicators, qualitative evidence gathered through fieldwork, interviews, and diagnostic processes reinforces the urgency and complexity of Argentina’s digital transformation challenges. These insights reveal not only structural and technological barriers, but also deeply rooted institutional and cultural dynamics that shape the country’s capacity to adopt and sustain digital innovation.\n\nAt the national level, research by organizations such as Fundar has shown that Argentina lacks centralized leadership for data governance and maintains no comprehensive inventory of public datasets. This results in significant ambiguity regarding which institutions produce specific data, how it is used, and under what standards. Even as transparency initiatives have led to the publication of open datasets, there are few institutional mechanisms in place to guarantee data quality, ensure interoperability, or promote strategic use. The absence of a national data strategy and formal governance frameworks severely limits the public sector’s ability to leverage information as a tool for innovation and decision-making.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Transformación digital: de arriba hacia abajo y de abajo hacia arriba", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_chars": 1638}}

Interviews conducted by CIPPEC with municipal officials reveal a widespread lack of coordination between departments, with most operating on isolated digital systems that do not share taxonomies, data models, or workflows. In practice, this results in fragmented service delivery, where citizens are forced to repeat procedures and information cannot be efficiently reused across agencies. Municipalities also report a persistent scarcity of technical personnel, particularly in areas like data science, software development, and AI application. The difficulty in hiring and retaining talent is exacerbated by low public sector salaries, limited career development opportunities, and a lack of internal training programs. While some local governments have begun to partner with universities or the private sector to address these issues, such initiatives tend to be informal and short-term, rather than part of institutional strategies.\n\nA concrete example of these limitations comes from the Province of Buenos Aires. Between September and November 2024, UNDP’s Accelerator Lab partnered with the Ministry of Community Development to conduct an in-depth assessment of its citizen request management system. Through interviews with front-desk staff, call center operators, social workers, request coordinators, and high-level officials, the diagnostic uncovered a highly fragmented structure. Different teams handled citizen requests independently, with little coordination, no shared protocols, and minimal use of integrated digital tools. Communication between teams often relied on informal channels such as WhatsApp or personal email accounts, raising concerns about data privacy and operational accountability. Many processes were tracked manually using outdated formats like Excel spreadsheets, making it difficult to monitor requests, follow up on unresolved issues, or analyze patterns to inform policy.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Transformación digital: de arriba hacia abajo y de abajo hacia arriba", "chunk_index": 6, "chunk_chars": 1981}}

Collective intelligence —through the open and structured exchange of ideas— presents a powerful opportunity to recover, amplify, and apply this knowledge. This collaborative approach can foster enabling conditions for resilience.

Core themes include the importance of mental health, fulfilling activities, and social and family support, as well as skepticism toward institutions and the need for effective state responses. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified feelings of disconnection and uncertainty, accelerating digitization while also revealing new vulnerabilities. Despite this, participants shared hopeful views of risk as an opportunity for transformation, linking resilience to creativity, autonomy, and future aspirations. The study identifies four key dimensions shaping resilience: mental health, the ambivalence of digitization, the value of community-based responses, and the demand for meaningful institutional action. At the heart of these findings lies a call to address disconnection—within oneself, with others, with nature, and with political leadership—making unwanted loneliness a relevant and timely area for further exploration and policy innovation. \n\nThe third initiative involved a solutions mapping exercise on access to justice for persons with disabilities, as part of a UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund initiative in collaboration with UNDP Argentina’s Democratic Governance cluster, UNICEF, WHO/PAHO, OHCHR, UNFPA, and UNHCR.

In response, they engage in a gradual and dynamic process of specialization, often beginning with solitary, self-directed efforts that evolve into deeper knowledge and more effective advocacy for their rights. This journey blends individual and collective learning, demanding significant emotional investment, strategic adjustments, and mutual support—ultimately fostering resilience across multiple levels. Networks of people with disabilities, civil society organizations, and informal groups play a vital role in this ecosystem, providing not only practical tools and guidance but also emotional support, solidarity, and safe spaces for empowerment that enable individuals and families to navigate systems and assert their rights more confidently. \n\nAdditionally, in partnership with the Uruguay River Binational Project and local authorities in Concepción (Province of Entre Ríos), we launched a collective intelligence initiative to co-develop action plans for protecting native plant species and eradicating invasive ones.

Together, we identified unwanted loneliness as a shared area of concern. Increasingly recognized as a public health issue, unwanted loneliness is often referred to as a modern epidemic—one that demands not only targeted interventions but also preventive and community-based responses. In this context, the involvement of local communities is essential to designing effective and contextually relevant solutions.\n\nThe complex interplay of various insecurity factors is becoming more evident. \n\nThese acute crises are giving way to chronic,  interconnected uncertainties on a global scale, creating a sense of unsettled lives and an uncertain future (2022a) [Figure 1]. Consequently, feelings of insecurity are rising across the globe [Figure 2].\n\nIn this uncertain context, where many people are experiencing distress, the focus on unwanted loneliness emerges as a timely and relevant issue—one with the potential to grow in importance and impact. Unwanted loneliness is a subjective, unwelcome feeling of lack or loss of companionship, which happens when we have a mismatch between the quantity and quality of social relationships that we have, and those that we want. It is often associated with social isolation, but people can and do feel lonely even when in a relationship or when surrounded by others.\n\nLoneliness affects people of all ages and from all backgrounds – from the school child who struggles to make friends, to the new parent coping alone, to the older person who has outlived her friends and immediate family. Feelings of loneliness affect us all at some point, but being lonely can become a serious problem when it becomes chronic – a day to-day reality which, over time, can grind us down, affecting our health and wellbeing and damaging our ability to connect with others.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Building resilience, threatened by unwanted loneliness", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_chars": 1924}}

Studies have found relatively consistent levels of chronic loneliness among older people – with between five and 15 per cent reporting that they are often or always lonely. However, we have much less robust data on loneliness among children, young people and adults of working age.\n\nSome recent surveys have uncovered levels of loneliness across all ages that are worryingly high. What we don’t yet know is if this is a sign of a growing problem, or because efforts to breakdown the stigma of loneliness are working, making people more willing to acknowledge their loneliness. Whichever it is, there is much to do (European Commission, 2018).\n\nThe most relevant factors associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing loneliness include, having a low level of education, living in incomplete nuclear or single-person households, perceiving financial hardship (feeling their income is insufficient), facing functional health limitations, lacking social support networks, not participating in formal or informal activities, not working, and not using the internet (GCBA, 2019)\n\nWe mapped 69 international initiatives addressing unwanted loneliness. Several key patterns emerged:\n\n• They adopt a community-centered approach, fostering social connection through networks, cultural activities, and the use of public spaces.\n\n• They promote intergenerational exchange, strengthening learning and solidarity across age groups.\n\n• They integrate urban planning strategies, designing public spaces that encourage interaction, ensure accessibility, and include green areas that promote well-being and a sense of belonging.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Building resilience, threatened by unwanted loneliness", "chunk_index": 6, "chunk_chars": 1787}}

While digital solutions cannot replace physical contact, they can be especially relevant in low-density areas or for individuals with limited mobility. Some initiatives also focus on reducing excessive screen time and mitigating the negative effects of overdependence on technology.\n\n• While a few countries have developed national action plans, many of the most impactful responses are local. Municipalities often lead the way, as the core resource for addressing unwanted loneliness lies in creating—and strengthening—community networks.\n\nStrong collaboration across governments, civil society, and the private sector is critical to scaling these efforts and amplifying their impact. At its core, this line of work is about creating the conditions for people to feel connected, supported, and empowered—laying the groundwork for more resilient communities.\n\nValue proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge?

This process allowed us to recognize common patterns—such as community-based approaches, intergenerational exchange, urban planning, digital inclusion, municipal-level interventions, and cross-sector partnerships—as well as to identify the groups most affected. As a result, we now have a portfolio of solutions that could potentially be adapted, replicated or scaled.\n\nAs we move forward in formalizing our partnership with the local government, we plan to develop a sensemaking strategy as part of our approach. This strategy will help build a systemic understanding of unwanted loneliness, surface shared narratives, and identify the social, cultural, and institutional factors influencing the phenomenon. It will also foster a common understanding of how loneliness manifests locally. To this end, we will organize high-level workshops with public officials to place the issue on the policy agenda and explore how various lines of government work—such as state modernization, urban planning, and public health—can impact unwanted loneliness. We also aim to triangulate qualitative and quantitative methods, involving diverse stakeholders to enrich and validate our understanding of the phenomenon.\n\nIn parallel, through participatory design, we aim to promote the evaluation, co-creation, and/or testing of solutions with a variety of stakeholders. The goal is to ensure that proposed interventions effectively respond to people’s real needs, can be adapted to specific contexts, and are sustainable over time.\n\nClick to see options\ndatasources: participatory design\ndatasources: participatory observation\ndatasources: qualitative data\ndatasources: quantitative data", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Building resilience, threatened by unwanted loneliness", "chunk_index": 10, "chunk_chars": 1873}}

Building on this line of work, unwanted loneliness remains a largely underexplored issue at the different national levels in Argentina. The data generated through this R&amp;D initiative will shed light on a challenge that has received limited attention from policymakers, offering both evidence and possibly momentum to elevate it on the public agenda.\n\nThe goal is not only to understand the scope of the problem in a specific local context—which could serve as a starting point to expand the research more broadly—but also to explore how people experience unwanted loneliness and what helps them navigate it. By centering their voices through in-depth, semi-structured interviews—some of which may adopt a life history approach—as well as through on-the-ground observations, we will gather insights.\n\nIn parallel, a solutions mapping exercise will help address a critical knowledge gap around practical, context-sensitive responses to this wicked problem. Analyzing these data sources will generate valuable insights that can inform future initiatives, which must be tailored to the local reality. This evidence will be crucial for designing culturally relevant, technically sound, and people-centered interventions.\n\nTogether, these methods will contribute to a more comprehensive and multidimensional understanding of resilience—one that highlights not only the challenges individuals and communities face, but also their agency—. Also, they will surface innovative practices that can inform future experimentation and policy design, bridging the gap between lived experience and systemic response.\nClosing", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Building resilience, threatened by unwanted loneliness", "chunk_index": 11, "chunk_chars": 1994}}

The rapid diffusion of these innovations often outstrips the ability of policymakers to regulate effectively, integrate them into governance structures, and anticipate their societal impact. This challenge is driven by a combination of factors, including limited institutional capacity, fragmented policy frameworks, and a lack of structured cross-sector dialogue between government, private sector innovators, academia, and civil society.\nIn North Macedonia, as in many other countries, regulatory frameworks remain reactive rather than anticipatory, creating governance gaps that hinder both responsible innovation and equitable access to emerging technologies. In addition, there are specific EU accession related transpositions of EU laws/ or approximations needed. Key challenges include a slow adaptation of legal and ethical standards, insufficient digital skills among policymakers, and underdeveloped mechanisms for citizen engagement in tech governance. As a result, technological advancements often lead to regulatory blind spots, ethical dilemmas, and unequal distribution of benefits, exacerbating digital divides and limiting the potential of emerging technologies to drive inclusive development. Addressing these issues requires forward-looking strategies, multi-stakeholder engagement, and adaptive governance models that enable policymakers to respond proactively to technological change.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Frontier Challenges: Emerging Tech: National Dialoges ", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1628}}

This hinders their capacity to manage waste effectively and operate sustainable enterprises. Additionally, there is a general lack of knowledge and misconceptions surrounding cooperatives in Zanzibar, leading to inefficiencies and underperformance.

What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\n​The community-based recycling cooperatives in Zanzibar have emerged in response to escalating waste management challenges, particularly due to rapid urbanization and a booming tourism industry. Historically, Zanzibar has grappled with inadequate formal waste management systems, especially in informal settlements, leading to environmental degradation and health hazards. In an effort to address these issues, grassroots initiatives have formed cooperatives to manage waste more effectively and create sustainable livelihoods.​academia.edu+1ijcrar.com+1", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "The Eco-Collective", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1831}}

A critical challenge is the lack of formal systems for solid waste management, which is more pronounced in informal settlements. Additionally, there is a scarcity of dedicated areas for recycling material drop-off, and the absence of a governmental garbage removal system exacerbates the situation. Furthermore, the cooperative movement in Zanzibar has experienced periods of decline, particularly after the Cooperative Union of Tanzania underwent reforms in 1991, leading to weakened organizational and support structures. ​ijcrar.com+1academia.edu+1zanzibarinsiderbuzz.wordpress.comsemanticscholar.org\n\nThe current situation is characterized by inefficient waste collection, improper disposal methods, and limited recycling activities. This inefficiency contributes to environmental pollution, posing health risks to the community and diminishing the aesthetic appeal of the islands, which can adversely affect tourism—a vital component of Zanzibar's economy. Moreover, the lack of financial literacy and business knowledge among cooperative members hinders the development of sustainable waste management enterprises, limiting income-generating opportunities and economic growth within these communities.​\n\nAddressing these challenges necessitates a comprehensive approach that includes capacity-building initiatives, infrastructure development, and policy support to empower these cooperatives.

In 2019, the Zanzibar Urban Municipal Council (ZUMC), in collaboration with the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), introduced the Urban Municipal Council Solid Waste Management Regulations. These regulations, the first of their kind in East Africa, are based on the 'Polluter Pays Principle' and aim to improve waste management practices across the island. Building on decentralized waste management pilot projects, such as the successful implementation in Shaurimoyo, these regulations emphasize waste segregation at the source and community involvement. Furthering its commitment to sustainable development, Zanzibar launched the Zanzibar Development Plan (ZADEP) 2021–2026, focusing on the Blue Economy for inclusive growth. This plan includes objectives to implement a National Waste Management Plan and establish dedicated waste disposal areas. These efforts align with Tanzania's broader strategies, as outlined in the Third National Development Plan 2021/22–2025/26, which emphasizes sustainable waste management and environmental conservation.

Although the approach has shown success in Tanga, its adaptation to Dodoma's socioeconomic and waste management scene calls for customized involvement techniques, creative payment models, and closer linkages with local government and cooperatives. This difficulty aims to pinpoint the main enablers and obstacles for sustainable development so guaranteeing inclusion, accessibility, and long-term profitability.\n\nBackground: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\nOriginally started in Tanga in response to the financial and social risks experienced by informal garbage workers, Taka Bima is the first microinsurance program for rubbish pickers in Tanzania. Designed under a collaboration between Taka ni Ajira Foundation, UNDP Accelerator Lab, and Jubilee Insurance, the project sought to give rubbish pickers financial protection, social security, and better working circumstances. Taka Bima has shown success in improving financial resilience among waste pickers since its founding by providing reasonably priced insurance coverage catered to their demand (UNDP, 2023).", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Scaling Microinsurance for Waste Pickers", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1941}}

Unlike Tanga, where well-organized garbage aggregation systems exist, Dodoma's waste industry stays mostly unorganized with scattered collecting and disposal methods. Financial fragility, limited insurance awareness, legal restrictions, and scalability issues all drive this difficulty (Taka ni Ajira Foundation, 2024). Dodoma's waste pickers are typically not financially literate and are reluctant to take insurance since they view it as unreliable or difficult. Furthermore, the lack of organized garbage cooperatives raises questions regarding the long-term viability of the project since it makes collective premium payments challenging.\n\nMoreover, institutional and legal obstacles impede fit into current social protection systems. Although the Tanzanian government has underlined financial inclusion via policies such the National Financial Inclusion Framework (NFIF) 2018–2022, informal workers are mostly left out of official insurance schemes (Bank of Tanzania, 2022). Adapting Taka Bima to this new terrain will depend critically on the Dodoma Municipal Council, local rubbish collectors, and financial institutions as well as on other factors.\n\nDodoma's waste pickers work without any kind of financial protection right now, which causes unstable income, poor access to healthcare, and dangerous working circumstances. A sudden medical emergency or accident might cause great financial difficulty, therefore aggravating poverty and economic uncertainty. Since they remain outside municipal garbage policies and official labor systems, the lack of insurance further reduces their negotiating strength. Furthermore, mistrust of official financial services implies that many waste pickers keep depending on unofficial savings systems, which lack long-term security (World Bank, 2023).", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Scaling Microinsurance for Waste Pickers", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1972}}

Important learning questions will probe adoption challenges, financial models, legal issues, and how technology could improve accessibility. The knowledge gained from this expansion will guide a national road map for including rubbish pickers into Tanzania's larger circular economy and social protection programs. By means of strategic alliances, creative business models, and community-driven participation, Taka Bima can establish a scalable and sustainable financial safety net for rubbish pickers spread around Tanzania.\n\nAlthough they have great difficulty, informal  waste pickers are absolutely vital in managing urban waste in Tanzania. Only 1.8% of waste pickers have health insurance; 88% of waste pickers finance their healthcare out-of-pocket according to a 2023 survey spanning eight areas including Dodoma. Their lack of financial security makes them susceptible to financial difficulties resulting from health emergencies. Insurance coverage is still poor nationally; just 6.3% of the adult population had official insurance in 2009, but unofficial insurance use is almost 2%. Although Dodoma generates around 350 tons of solid garbage every day, only roughly 184 tons are collected through official services. Collecting valuable items such plastic bottles (86.2%), plastic containers (66.5%), and metals (55.8%), informal rubbish pickers help to close this gap. Even with their contributions, women frequently operate in dangerous environments without protective gear, which increases health risks and injuries. Acknowledging their critical importance in trash management, scaling microinsurance projects like Taka Bima in Dodoma is crucial to guarantee these workers financial stability and healthcare.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Scaling Microinsurance for Waste Pickers", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1841}}

A 2023 survey revealed that over 50% of waste pickers earn below the poverty line, with 35% making between TZS 3,000 to TZS 5,000 daily, equivalent to USD 1.11–USD 1.85. This economic hardship limits their access to essential services like health insurance. Additionally, Dodoma's rapid urbanization has led to inadequate waste management infrastructure, resulting in illegal dumping and environmental degradation. Despite their significant contributions to waste management, waste pickers often face stigmatization and lack formal recognition, exacerbating their vulnerability. These factors collectively emphasize the critical need for interventions that provide financial security and social support to waste pickers in Dodoma.\n\nValue proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge?

What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\n\nIn Guatemala, investing in circular economy initiatives presents both immense potential and significant barriers. The high upfront costs required for infrastructure and technology make these investments accessible only to wealthy investors or governments capable of securing large loans. Projects such as hydroelectric dams, water treatment plants, recycling facilities, as well as environmentally friendly production of food and other goods or services highlight the challenge. \n\nFor example, constructing a hydroelectric dam can cost millions of dollars, and while it is profitable and in the long term, the immediate benefits are often concentrated in specific stakeholders, such as energy companies, while the social and environmental costs -like displacement or ecosystem disruption- fall on local communities. This asymmetry in benefits frequently results in resistance, as seen with several hydroelectric projects in Guatemala that were vandalized or opposed by communities who felt excluded from their benefits.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Circular Economy Investments powered by AI and Blockchain", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1972}}

A small community recycling center, for example, can cost tens of thousands of dollars to establish, requiring land acquisition, machinery, and operational costs. Yet, the immediate financial returns are often slow, and the benefits -such as reduced environmental pollution- are spread across broader society rather than providing direct, tangible gains to individual contributors. This creates a collective action problem: individuals or small groups are unlikely to invest unless there are immediate returns and guarantees that others will also contribute. \n\nCompounding this challenge is the tendency for financing to support consumption rather than investment. For instance, remittances in Guatemala are often used to expand homes or purchase consumer goods rather than fund productive, sustainable projects like composting centers or irrigation systems. These consumption-driven choices limit the creation of shared assets that could yield long-term environmental and economic benefits.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Circular Economy Investments powered by AI and Blockchain", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1135}}

Tokenization allows large-scale investments to be divided into smaller, tradable digital tokens, enabling broader participation and ownership. Globally, we have seen initial applications of blockchain in renewable energy projects, such as tokenizing solar farms, where individuals can buy tokens representing a share of the energy produced. In Guatemala, early steps have been taken to tokenize real estate and solar panel production projects. For instance, local developers are experimenting with tokenized ownership of solar installations, allowing individuals to invest in a fraction of the panels and receive returns proportional to the energy generated. This model democratizes access, reduces reliance on single high-capital investors, and ensures that benefits are shared more equitably. \n\nAdding to these developments, artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to play a critical role in addressing the challenges of circular economy investments. AI-powered systems can enhance the efficiency and scalability of circular economy projects by optimizing operations and identifying opportunities for cost reduction. For example, AI algorithms can analyze energy usage in solar farms or irrigation systems, ensuring optimal performance and reducing waste. AI-driven predictive analytics can also help entrepreneurs and investors better understand market trends and assess the financial viability of projects, making investments less risky and more attractive.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Circular Economy Investments powered by AI and Blockchain", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1585}}

Smart contracts integrated with AI can automatically verify compliance with agreements, distribute benefits equitably, and resolve disputes based on predefined rules, reducing reliance on Guatemala’s often weak justice system. Additionally, AI-driven platforms can improve accessibility by creating personalized user experiences and simplifying complex tokenization systems, making them easier for non-technical users to adopt.\n\nDespite these promising developments, challenges remain. Tokenization and AI technologies are not yet practical for widespread use. Legal frameworks and tax regulations for digital assets are unclear, and business models that ensure profitability and scalability for circular economy projects need to be refined. Moreover, community adoption depends on addressing the asymmetry of costs and benefits. For example, in an apartment building, installing solar panels requires upfront contributions from all residents, but the benefits, such as lower energy costs, may not be equally distributed unless mechanisms are in place to ensure fair participation and returns.\n\nA practical starting point for tokenized investments in Guatemala could be small-scale food production and waste management projects. Composting facilities or community irrigation systems, for instance, are manageable in scale and directly benefit the communities that participate in them. Tokenization could allow individuals to collectively fund these projects, ensuring shared ownership and returns. Paired with AI-driven optimization and management tools, these projects could maximize their efficiency and impact while fostering trust and equitable participation.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Circular Economy Investments powered by AI and Blockchain", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1798}}

At the center of the issue are the high upfront costs associated with circular economy projects, such as building composting facilities, water treatment plants, or recycling centers, as well as adopting energy-saving technologies like solar panels or irrigation systems. \n\nThese initiatives require significant capital, which is largely inaccessible to the majority of the population.

Without a robust social security system or widespread formal employment, most people prioritize short-term consumption over long-term savings or investment. For many, saving money is not an option, because there is no safety net to rely on in times of need. Instead, people channel their earnings into immediate experiences, such as dining out or purchasing consumer goods like clothing and electronics. Remittances, which constitute a major source of income for many families, are often used to buy vehicles, expand or renovate homes, or travel. While land purchases are culturally valued as a way to safeguard savings, this practice “parks” capital rather than circulating it productively within the economy, further limiting opportunities for collective investment in sustainable projects. \n\nAnother significant barrier is the pervasive lack of trust in Guatemala’s social and institutional structures. Interpersonal trust is low, making it difficult for individuals to embark on joint investments or collaborate on collective ventures. This is exacerbated by a weak justice system that struggles to enforce contracts or resolve disputes, creating additional risks for those considering cooperative efforts. While cooperatives provide some degree of trusted financial services, their scope is largely limited to saving and lending, and they do not facilitate more complex investment ventures, such as financing for circular economy projects.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Circular Economy Investments powered by AI and Blockchain", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_chars": 1583}}

Projects like composting facilities, recycling plants, or agricultural waste management systems often lack reliable revenue streams or well-stablished frameworks for generating returns. Potential investors are hesitant to commit resources without a clear understanding of how these projects will become profitable. This uncertainty further compounds the challenges for those seeking to implement sustainable practices. \n\nAdding to these issues is the difficulty of adopting and implementing the necessary technologies. Circular economy projects often require integrating multiple systems, such as blockchain-based tools for tokenization or energy efficient technologies, which demand a level of technical expertise that is not widely available. The lack of prepackaged, user-friendly solutions means that individuals and organizations must navigate complex technological processes, which can be a significant barrier, particularly in rural or underserved areas with limited digital literacy. \n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) offers potential to address several of these challenges but also highlights additional gaps in adoption. AI systems can optimize operations for circular economy projects, such as managing energy consumption in solar installations or improving the efficiency of recycling processes. AI-driven predictive analytics can also identify market trends, help businesses assess project viability, and guide decision-making, reducing risks for potential investors. However, the integration of AI requires technical infrastructure, skilled professionals, and significant upfront investment—all of which are limited in Guatemala. Furthermore, the cultural and institutional gaps that hinder blockchain adoption, such as low trust and weak legal enforcement, also apply to AI, making its deployment challenging in collaborative or community-focused projects.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Circular Economy Investments powered by AI and Blockchain", "chunk_index": 6, "chunk_chars": 1981}}

In Guatemala, there is limited awareness of the long-term benefits of circular economy practices, and many people view sustainability as an additional cost rather than an opportunity. This mindset, coupled with the economic necessity of prioritizing immediate needs, makes it difficult to shift behavior toward more sustainable practices. Informal markets, which dominate much of the economy, further complicate efforts to scale up circular economy initiatives, as affordability and short-term gains often take precedence over efficiency or sustainability. \n\nFinally, Guatemala’s policy and regulatory environment does little to encourage circular economy investments. There are few incentives, such as tax breaks or subsidies, to support sustainable initiatives. Moreover, the legal framework for innovative financial instruments, like blockchain-based tokenization or AI-enhanced investment models, is underdeveloped, creating uncertainty for those looking to implement these solutions. Tokenization offers the potential to democratize access to circular economy investments by dividing large projects into smaller, tradable digital tokens that enable broader participation. AI can further enhance these models by improving decision-making, streamlining processes, and offering transparency. Early efforts in Guatemala, such as tokenizing solar panel production or real estate assets, demonstrate the potential of these technologies. However, the lack of clarity around legal contracts, taxes, and business models makes it difficult to scale these efforts effectively.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Circular Economy Investments powered by AI and Blockchain", "chunk_index": 7, "chunk_chars": 1618}}

High costs, limited access to financing, social distrust, technological gaps, and policy shortcomings all converge to create a landscape where sustainable investments remain out of reach for most people. Addressing these barriers will require coordinated efforts to provide better financing mechanisms, build trust, develop clear business models, and make technology—including blockchain and AI—more accessible. Without such changes, the promise of a circular economy will remain unrealized, and the long-term benefits of sustainability will continue to be overshadowed by short-term priorities. \n\nThe adoption of circular economy practices in Guatemala remains limited, despite their increasing necessity in the face of environmental degradation and pollution. The country’s reliance on nature-based products, such as agriculture and forestry, makes sustainable practices critical. However, pollution, deforestation, and poor waste management continue to degrade the natural resources on which these industries depend, threatening both environmental health and economic stability.  \n\nCircular economy practices, while essential, are difficult to adopt due to a combination of factors. A lack of knowledge about their benefits and implementation, high upfront costs, and low perceived immediate returns create significant barriers. Most small business as and individuals do not see the long-term advantages of sustainability if it means incurring additional expenses or shifting away from traditional methods. As a result, these practices are often deprioritized in favor of maintaining short-term affordability and efficiency.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Circular Economy Investments powered by AI and Blockchain", "chunk_index": 8, "chunk_chars": 1770}}

Informal entrepreneurs, who constitute a significant portion of the economy, typically operate with limited resources and focus on minimizing costs to stay competitive. They are unlikely to invest in new technologies or practices unless these are low-cost, easy to adopt, and provide clear and immediate benefits. The weak state institutions and fragmented regulatory environment make top-down approaches, such as mandates or subsidies, challenging to enforce. Instead, successful adoption will depend on user-driven approaches that demonstrate tangible advantages for individuals and small businesses. \n\nOverall, the current state of circular economy adoption in Guatemala highlights the need for targeted efforts to address knowledge gaps, lower costs, and create incentives for user-driven adoption. The urgency of environmental degradation and the economic reliance on natural resources make this a critical moment to rethink how circular economy practices can be integrated into the country’s informal and resource-constrained economy.

While Guatemala’s contribution to global climate change is negligible, the country faces increasing vulnerability to the effects of climate change, particularly the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Environmental degradation exacerbates this vulnerability, making it much harder for the country to adapt effectively. Without sustainable practices, the resilience of ecosystems and communities is further undermined, leaving Guatemala ill-equipped to cope with the impacts of climate change. Environmental degradation has already begun to compromise access to natural resources that are vital for the economy, food production, and societal functioning. Deforestation, water pollution, soil contamination, and declining air quality are creating cascading challenges across multiple sectors. The availability of clean water is particularly critical and increasingly precarious. Watersheds and rivers are polluted at alarming rates, threatening both rural and urban communities’ access to clean water for drinking, agriculture, and industry. Similarly, the pollution and depletion of soil resources are undermining the country’s agricultural productivity, a strategic resource for Guatemala’s economy and food security. The consequences of poor waste management are also mounting. Existing dump sites are nearing or have already reached capacity, collapsing under the strain of unchecked waste production. The lack of functional infrastructure for waste treatment and recycling is accelerating environmental damage and creating immediate health and safety risks for nearby communities. If these issues remain unaddressed, the capacity of Guatemala’s environment to sustain its population will continue to decline, jeopardizing long-term development.

Under the existing framework, circular economy investments are primarily accessible to wealthy investors or larger organizations, leaving out small businesses and lower-income communities. These groups are often unable or unwilling to bear the upfront costs or the operational burdens associated with adopting sustainable practices. This inequitable distribution of costs and benefits creates significant social tensions, particularly when individuals and communities are expected to adapt without adequate support or access to the opportunities created by the transition. This dynamic as the potential to fuel social conflict, as communities resist measures they perceive as unjust or overly burdensome. For instance, limitations on waste disposal or water use imposed without corresponding access to sustainable alternatives could spark widespread discontent. Similarly, if the economic benefits of circular economy practices are concentrated among a privileged few, public support for the transition will erode, further polarizing society and hindering progress. In sum, delaying the adoption of circular economy practices exacerbates Guatemala’s vulnerability to climate change, depletes the natural resources that underpin its economy and society, and increases the likelihood of social conflict. Addressing these undesired effects requires not only accelerating the adoption of sustainable practices but also ensuring that the transition is equitable, inclusive, and supported by systems that enable all segments of society to participate and benefit.

What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\nOver the past decades, Viet Nam has experienced rapid economic growth, transitioning from a low-income to a low-middle-income country. While this progress is a positive milestone, it has led to a significant decline in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as international donors shift their focus to lower-income nations. As a result, UNDP Viet Nam and the Accelerator Lab must explore alternative funding models to sustain our work in driving innovation for sustainable development. \n\nThis challenge is further compounded by a global decline in international development funding, as donor priorities shift towards domestic concerns and emerging global crises. Development organizations worldwide are facing increased pressure to demonstrate financial sustainability and justify their value proposition beyond traditional models.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Finding Market-fit Service Offering for Vietnam AccLab", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1799}}

While this has created a temporary bureaucratic freeze, there are emerging policy opportunities, particularly with Resolutions 57 and 03, which signal a strong governmental push for science, technology, and innovation (STI). This shift presents a window for the Lab to position itself as a key partner in Viet Nam’s innovation landscape. \n\nHowever, a fundamental challenge remains: Viet Nam’s government has historically not paid for UN services. Unlike the private sector or donor-funded initiatives, government institutions are accustomed to receiving ODA rather than using their own budgets to procure services from international organizations. This lack of precedent presents both a mindset and structural barrier to positioning UNDP and the Accelerator Lab as a viable service provider in innovation consulting. \n\nAs a result, the current situation produces several undesired effects: \n\n- Uncertain financial sustainability of the Lab beyond 2025, risking a loss of innovation capacity within UNDP Viet Nam. \n\n- Limited agility in responding to local needs, as reliance on donor funding dictates priorities rather than market-driven demand. \n\n- Missed opportunities for client partnership with the Vietnamese government, as existing UNDP support is often viewed through the lens of donor-funded technical assistance rather than as a strategic service offering. \n\n- To overcome these challenges, the Lab must navigate a fundamental shift in how it operates—transforming from a donor-dependent initiative into a financially sustainable, market-responsive innovation service provider.\n\nDeclining ODA and Shifting Donor Priorities:", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Finding Market-fit Service Offering for Vietnam AccLab", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1731}}

This report details how key donors—including Japan, USAID, and the EU—are adjusting their portfolios, leading to significant reductions in concessional aid. Such recalibration underscores the urgency for Vietnam to explore alternative funding mechanisms to sustain its development agenda. \n\nInnovation Policy and R&amp;D Investment: \nRecent policy moves, such as Vietnam’s Resolution 57-NQ/TW (2023) and Resolution 03/NQ-CP (2024), aim to boost the nation’s innovation ecosystem by enhancing digital transformation and public–private partnerships. Meanwhile, World Bank data indicate that current R&amp;D investment is around 0.5% of GDP, with a target of 2% by 2030—an ambitious goal to drive sustainable economic transformation.\n\nOur existing relationship with government partner such as the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), the National Innovation Center (NIC), and provincial such as Danang and Hue hint at a growing interest in leveraging UNDP expertise for innovation consulting. This is something we have done for free in previous years, but it can be potential entry point for UNDP’s services. \n\nNew leadership in Vietnam and a strong push in innovation and technology such as with Resolution 57 and 03 in 2024-2025 to push investment in R&amp;D indicate a room of opportunity", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Finding Market-fit Service Offering for Vietnam AccLab", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1994}}

However, poor stakeholder coordination and data gaps hinder progress in this sector. The Travel &amp; Tourism Development Index 2024 ranks Bangladesh the lowest in South Asia for policies enabling sustainable tourism development, underscoring urgent reform needs. To establish Bangladesh as a sustainable and inclusive global tourism hub, the Bangladesh Tourism Board (BTB) developed a 25-year Master Plan. Data gaps in areas like sustainable tourism, traditional local products sources and visitor expectations led to a strategic collaboration between BTB and UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab for informed policy development and implementation.\n\nIn Bangladesh, tourism sector contributes slightly greater than 3% in the national GDP, whereas Maldives one-third of the national GDP is contributed by the tourism sector. Approximately, 5 million people are directly or indirectly engaged in the tourism sector of Bangladesh and additional 2 million workforce will be added in this sector gradually within 2030. Despite immense potential and natural resources, Bangladesh is unable to reap the full benefits of tourism due to lack of centralized data framework and a holistic tourism plan.\n\nhttps://www.undp.org/bangladesh/blog/mapping-tourists-mind-introduce-and-nurture-data-driven-decision-making-culture-tourism-sector-creating-informal-employment", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Bangladesh Tourism Master Plan: Experimenting AI-powered Data Framework as a Transformative Tool", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1509}}

The Accelerator Lab has strong collaboration with Bangladesh Tourism Board (BTB) and both parties jointly conducted relevant interventions in multiple locations of the country. The lab also contributed to formulating in Bangladesh Tourism Master Plan which outlines a 25-year strategy to position the country as a premier global tourist destination by 2041. UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab is uniquely positioned to contribute to developing a National Data Framework to implement Bangladesh Tourism Master Plan in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. From its multilateral partnership, the Accelerator Lab is also positioned to bring in Government agencies, private sector stakeholders, industry association for their participation and organizational buy-in. The Lab will also connect relevant Global Accelerator Labs for knowledge and experience sharing. Previously, UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab collaborated with UNDP Thailand acceleration Lab on sharing learning and experience on community-based tourism. These global knowledge sharing adds tremendous value in such initiatives. Lab will also leverage Artificial Intelligence in implementation of the Tourism Master Plan.\n\nhttps://file.portal.gov.bd/uploads/8ef2a505-c131-4a8f-b6d0-2ac4760cc936/631/6c4/06a/6316c406a9807875210649.pdf\n\nShort “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?\nNational Data Framework for Bangladesh Tourism Master Plan for Data Innovation and AI-powered sustainable tourism.\n#UNDP_BD Accelerator Lab #DataInnovation\n#AIpoweredTourism #Bangladesh\nChallenge classification\nnull\nClick to see options\nthematic_areas: artificial intelligence\nthematic_areas: Big data analysis\n Decision-making system\nthematic_areas: Data Analytics\nthematic_areas: Data Visualization\nthematic_areas: digital transformation", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Bangladesh Tourism Master Plan: Experimenting AI-powered Data Framework as a Transformative Tool", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1992}}

What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\n\nHistory and Drivers:\n\nThe challenge originates from the limitations of existing systems that are unable to provide real-time and accurate monitoring of social tensions in Syria. This deficiency is driven by a lack of integration and coordination among various data sources and methodologies currently in use. The systems in place are not equipped to harness modern technological capabilities such as AI-driven analytics and comprehensive data aggregation, which are essential for timely and predictive insights into social dynamics and potential conflicts.\n\nInvolved Parties:", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Social Tension Early Warning System | Horizon 360", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1676}}

Each group plays a specific role in gathering, analyzing, and responding to data, but the effectiveness of their efforts is hindered by the disjointed nature of existing systems.\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nCurrently, the systems for monitoring social tensions are fragmented and lack the capability to provide a unified, real-time view of emerging risks. Similarly, needs assessments are often siloed and do not fully integrate the insights and input from local communities, especially marginalized and vulnerable groups. This results in interventions that may not be fully aligned with the actual needs on the ground.\n\nUndesired Effects:\n\nThe primary undesired effect of these challenges is the increased likelihood of escalating tensions due to missed opportunities for early intervention. When emerging risks are not promptly or accurately identified, preventive actions cannot be taken, potentially leading to conflicts that could have been mitigated or avoided. Additionally, the lack of effective participatory needs assessments means that recovery and development efforts may not effectively address the most pressing community needs, leading to less efficient use of resources and reduced impact of interventions.\n\n1.

Plans are currently being developed to further expand geothermal and solar capacity, as well as evaluate the inclusion of other energy sources. However, the country faces challenges in managing high energy costs due to its hybrid model, which involves the participation of both the public and private sectors in the entire energy system.\n\nOne of the critical problems is the high cost of private sector participation in energy distribution. Although energy coverage in rural areas has reached 96.6% (EHPM, 2023), closing the remaining gap is costly. Furthermore, energy demand in rural areas is expected to increase, driven by agricultural productivity and socioeconomic activities such as tourism.\n\nNext year, the country will propose a comprehensive review of the legal and policy framework of the energy sector, which represents an opportunity to include social needs and less developed sectors without slowing economic and sustainable growth.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Digital AgroEnergy: Sustainable Innovation in Agri-Food Development (AIDA)", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1699}}

It relies heavily on non-renewable energy sources, operates with insufficient infrastructure and has low adoption of advanced technologies. These factors increase production costs, limit operational efficiency and endanger food security and the economic sustainability of the sector.\n\nThe country's vulnerability to climate change exacerbates these problems, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions to strengthen resilience in agri-food production. Addressing these challenges requires a gender-sensitive approach and disaggregated data to develop more effective and inclusive measures.\n\nOne of the biggest gaps in the agri-food sector is the lack of accurate and up-to-date data on energy consumption, which makes it difficult to make informed decisions and implement effective energy efficiency policies. In addition, technological, economic and regulatory barriers hinder the integration of renewable energies and digital technologies—such as the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)—that have the potential to transform the sector into a more sustainable and competitive model.\n\nBackground: What is the history of your challenge?

However, the country still faces challenges due to its hybrid energy model, which includes both public and private sector involvement. The inclusion of private sector players in the energy distribution system is contributing to high costs, which places a financial burden on consumers and the economy.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the growing energy demand in rural areas, which is expected to rise as agricultural productivity and tourism expand. While there has been impressive progress in providing energy coverage—reaching 96.6% of rural areas in 2023—closing the remaining gap is expensive and resource-intensive.\n\nData bases from the General Directorate of Energy, Hydrocarbons and Mines on kW consumed in the country and survey data bases collected by FAO.\n\nhttps://ground.news/article/hydropower-and-lng-propel-el-salvadors-energy-growth-in-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n\nValue proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge?

(Please answer in specific terms: \"Our challenge is that...”.)\nThe widespread use of plastic bags in plant production contributes significantly to environmental degradation through waste accumulation, soil contamination and microplastic pollution. The challenge is to move away from these single-use plastics to sustainable, environmentally friendly alternatives that provide the necessary protection and functionality for plant growth, while ensuring cost effectiveness and long-term agricultural sustainability.\n\nBackground: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\nIn Cape Verde, the excessive use of plastic bags in the plant production sector, whether endemic, forestry or fruit trees, is a major environmental challenge.\nHistorically, the use of non-biodegradable single-use plastic bags in the plant production sector has been widely promoted in the archipelago due to their easy availability, ease of use, affordable cost and lack of knowledge about sustainable alternatives.\nThe reliance on the use of these plastic bags in nurseries has contributed to increased pollution and potential degradation of sensitive ecosystems and habitats, such as those found in the country's network of protected areas.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Towards a Plastic-Free Future: A Learning Plan for Sustainable Plant Production", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1919}}

From 18 May 2025, the introduction of single-use plastic products into the national market will also be banned.\nThe measure was taken to reduce environmental impact and promote more sustainable practices.\nSome data on the use of plastics in Cape Verde:\nPlastics make up almost a third of the waste in Cape Verde's landfills.\nPlastics can take between 100 and 500 years to decompose in nature.\nImproper disposal of plastics can pollute oceans, rivers and soil.\nPlastic incineration can release toxic gases.\nThe list of banned plastic materials includes\nNon-recyclable or non-biodegradable carrier bags\nDisposable tableware\nBottles smaller than half a litre\nPolystyrene containers for food and drink\nDisposable cutlery and plates\nBalloon sticks\n\nIn Cape Verde, several subtle but telling signals are pointing to the growing urgency of reducing the use of plastic bags in crop production. This urgency is further underlined by the recent government mandate to ban single-use plastics by 31 December 2024. This regulation reinforces the need to transition to sustainable alternatives in line with national environmental policies. Below are some qualitative indicators of this urgent challenge:\n\nCommunity observations and concerns:\nLocal residents and agricultural workers have observed growing accumulations of plastic waste around plant nurseries and near protected ecosystems. This visible pollution, coupled with growing public dissatisfaction, points to an urgent need for environmentally friendly alternatives, especially in light of the upcoming ban.\n\nEnvironmental impact reports:", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Towards a Plastic-Free Future: A Learning Plan for Sustainable Plant Production", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1971}}

The country’s 710 km coastline is frequently impacted by cyclones, storm surges, and flooding. Historical records show devastating cyclones, such as those in 1970 and 1988, 1988, which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Over the decades, the increasing frequency and intensity of these disasters have been linked to climate change, rising sea levels, and degraded natural defenses like mangrove forests. The coastal regions of Bangladesh face a persistent cycle of disasters, including cyclones (e.g., Cyclone Amphan in 2020), tidal floods, and saltwater intrusion. While disaster preparedness has improved over the years with better early warning systems and cyclone shelters, challenges remain in ensuring resilience. Many embankments are breached annually, displacing thousands. The salinization of agricultural land has reduced crop yields, while coastal erosion destroys homes and infrastructure. Data from Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016 says 24.1% of households in the river char areas and 26% of households in the coastal char lands earn less than Tk. 7,000 monthly, while the national figure stands at 22.6%.

Recent examples include Cyclone Sidr (2007), which caused over 3,000 fatalities, and Cyclone Amphan (2020), which resulted in damages exceeding $13 billion (USD). Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) said that over 50% of coastal land in Bangladesh is affected by saltwater intrusion, reducing agricultural productivity by 15-20% annually. and crop yields for staples like rice have declined significantly in saline-prone areas, contributing to food insecurity for millions. However, it is a common phenomenon that the char dwellers always fight with the hunger, poverty, illiteracy, less farm productivity, climatic disaster, etc. Island people are poor, illiterate and deprived of employment opportunities and health facilities. According to World Bank, nearly 12 million people live in poverty in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. The existing fearful living of char dwellers and livelihood conditions, for instance, vulnerabilities arising from natural disasters such as flood, erosion, storm, cyclone, tidal surge; poverty, which is 2.7 times higher than the national average, and its consequent malnutrition; illiteracy; inadequate education, health and sanitation services; and limited rights to, if not absence of, land and livelihood resources, leave them in a never ending fight for survival.

Because of its special location, the lab can act as a link between various organizations by creating a framework for multi-layered collaboration. Nonetheless, the Lab has previously focused on informal economy and alternative livelihood projects that combine Bangladeshi coastal regions' blue tourism. We will therefore be able to use the lessons learnt in small islands thanks to the extensive experience.

Active involvement of residents and local actors fosters trust, a key element in overcoming the fragmentation of social cohesion in the neighborhood.\n\nBarriers to safety are multifaceted: The mapping identified various physical and socioeconomic barriers that hindered the sense of safety in Barrio Norte, such as poorly maintained public spaces, lack of lighting, areas of high violence, but also higher income areas where people felt excluded to go. Understanding these barriers allowed for the identification of priorities for improvement based on local concerns.\n\nLocal knowledge is essential for contextualizing interventions: Community insights, stories, and local perspectives provided a valuable lens for designing interventions. Residents had a nuanced understanding of their own challenges, which allowed the team to tailor recommendations to the specific needs, dynamics and history of the area, ensuring higher relevance and potential impact.\n\nDegradation of public spaces contributes to social isolation: The participatory mapping revealed how the design and maintenance of public spaces in Barrio Norte contribute to social fragmentation.

We originally proposed only SMES and entrepreneurs with tested solutions, but in deliberation we decided to expand to explore a broader diversity of applications. It was good to see the landscape of what emerged but made the competition un-balanced as the different solutions where in different stages that showed stark differences. The winner was a local government, which based on the criteria evaluation resulted as such, but perhaps it could have been a separate category of solutions to apply (local governments as a sole category, for example)", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "A Wave of Innovation in Action: Results of the Escalatón ‘The Plastic Circle’", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1477}}

Each challenge must be submitted individually.\nEXPLORATORY\n\nChallenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: \"Our challenge is that...”.)\nIf you look around, you'll see plastic everywhere. Without going too far, you're probably reading this on your phone, tablet, or laptop, all of which contain plastic components. It's a material that has revolutionized our daily lives and seems to make everything easier. However, this convenience comes at a cost: just look at the rivers and streams in Panama City to see how tons of waste, mostly plastic, end up in the ocean. Or consider the fires at Cerro Patacón, our city's landfill and open-air dumps that make it hard for us to breathe. It's essential to shift from a produce, consume, and dispose model to a plastic circle that protects our ecosystems and our health.\n\nBackground: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\nAt least 91% of the plastics we import are final products: flip-flops, containers, tables, or chairs. Between 2015 and 2019 alone, Panama imported an annual average of 160,704 tons of plastic raw materials, yet we lack sufficient environmentally responsible systems and mechanisms to manage and dispose of them at the end of their lifecycle. We need innovative solutions to create a circular system that prevents plastic pollution. This is why UNDP is exploring various starting points to accelerate the transition toward a circular economy.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "A Plastic Circle for a Zero-Waste Panama", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1965}}

Other analysis, such as the one on imports and exports of plastics and rubber show a sneak peek on the complexity of this issue and the need to take urgent action from global to local levels.\n\nThrough the solutions mapping process, we identified a niche of solutions that come from private sector, entrepreneurs, businesses and academia that could enhance the transition towards circular systems for plastics at a local level, at the same time, we identified that key initiatives for plastics circularity such as the Blue/Natural Heritage project could be articulated to better support entrepreneurial, local efforts.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "A Plastic Circle for a Zero-Waste Panama", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1822}}

However, individuals face a significant challenge in verifying the accuracy of all received news, which is an extremely time-consuming process. They need tools that help them access reliable information. \n\n- VULNERABILITY TO POOR INFORMATION INTEGRITY IS ASYMMETRICAL AMONG POPULATIONS: How people access and consume information varies greatly depending on who they are. Factors like their age, gender, the language they speak (especially for Indigenous populations), whether they have disabilities, and their level of education all play a role. For example, women expressed that in households it is common that men are the ones accessing information and making calls based on it that involves the family, like what is allowed or what measures are going to be taken.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Learnings from codesigning information integrity protocols through multi-stakeholder approach", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1661}}

This needs strong coordination among all involved ministries, clearly defined protocols, capacity building initiatives, and the unequivocal endorsement of the head of each ministry. Effective communication must be prioritized at the highest levels of each ministry to empower their respective comms teams. \n\n- IN THE FACE OF EVENTS, A LAG IN COMMUNICATION CAN DEEPEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS: In the face of sudden security issues—e.g., attacks by organized crime—citizens need immediate reassurance from their government that action is being taken, even if the details are still being confirmed. Slow government responses generate doubt and uncertainty, conveying the image that the government is not equipped to protect its citizens.

(Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) \n1. The free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) process conducted as part of this initiative was crucial in establishing trust within the communities and highlighted the importance of acknowledging and including indigenous governance structures in decision-making processes. In the case of the Emberá-Wounaan Territory, their participation and the integration of indigenous knowledge in designing solutions to the migration crisis in Darién are essential. \n\n2. It is key to understand the historical trajectory of these communities to address the current migration crisis. Active listening during the creation of the Canaán and Bajo Chiquito timeline demonstrated the role of memory in understanding the various dynamics of social cohesion and collective action that have influenced the lives of both communities. These are also starting points for more effective solutions that strengthen the social fabric and resilience at the local level, linking humanitarian aid, peace, and development. \n\n3. A futures &amp; foresight approach is needed to anticipate the differentiated effects that changes in migration flows have on host communities, with a gender-focused approach.

From unpaid salaries to losing a home to illegal detention. When facing troubles, where does one go to seek justice? Especially if courts are far away, legal advice is expensive and delays are painful? More than five billion people(link is external), around two-thirds of the world’s population, lack meaningful access to formal justice systems.At the same time governments and institutions are under growing pressure, with more demands and fewer resources. Justice systems are no exception. Despite playing a vital role in keeping societies fair and stable, they receive just 1.4 percent of global development assistance(link is external). But what if we could make justice work better, faster and fairer by doing things differently? Good practices are already there. UNDP’s Justice Futures CoLab and Accelerator Labs are helping surface and scale them. We piloted peer learning to enhance justice services on the ground. Innovation in actionRethinking how people experience justice is at the heart of innovation. Low-cost, people-centred initiatives are already reshaping justice services, with UNDP playing a leading role in co-developing and scaling these solutions in close partnership with national institutions and communities.In Ecuador, families affected by femicide worked with the Accelerator Lab to develop 'Flowers in the Air', a storytelling map that geolocates the stories of women who were killed. These powerful narratives are now used to train judges and prosecutors, helping shift attitudes about gender-based violence. So far, over 450 judicial officials have been trained, and the model is expanding nationwide through a new online platform.In Eswatini(link is external), long transfer times between prisons and courts have contributed to growing pre-trial detention delays.

This reduced the need to transport detainees, cut costs and improved court efficiency. Crucially, the team collaborated closely with the Office of the Chief Justice to ensure the digitalized procedures fit existing legal processes. It now covers all four High Courts and is being adapted for bail and plea hearings.In the Democratic Republic of Congo, poor record-keeping and long delays were common. An in-house justice reform programme, supported by the Accelerator Lab, developed a suite of open-source tools for prison management, case tracking, criminal record issuance and staff deployment. These three tools are now live in three provinces, where clerks report search times dropping from days to minutes. Justice authorities have asked the team to prepare a scale-up plan, and it is now seeking funding to expand the approach further. \n\n The powerful narratives of programmes such as 'Flowers in the Air' confront deeper, systemic challenges and imbalanced power dynamics.

While technology played a role, the most critical factor was the partnerships and trust built between communities, governments and justice actors.However, lasting change requires more than strong relationships and smart tools. It demands confronting deeper, systemic challenges, such as outdated regulations, imbalanced power dynamics and harmful social norms that hold justice systems back. For innovation to be sustainable it must be linked to broader reforms. Innovation also can’t happen in isolation. The most impactful initiatives emerged when justice, governance and digital development teams worked together. This delivered meaningful results at minimal cost, proving that innovation is a necessity for achieving more with less.What’s next? Looking forward, the goal is to scale what already works and build the infrastructure to sustain it. That means investing in shared tools, open digital platforms and continuous learning. The Justice Futures CoLab and Accelerator Labs will keep driving this forward, connecting innovators, amplifying country-led solutions, and exploring new areas like digital public goods and smarter ways to measure justice needs.Justice innovation isn’t a one-off experiment. It’s a long-term, collective effort to make justice more accessible, affordable and responsive for all.Ready to go further?

Now, we examine how experimentation is transitioning from one-off projects to a norm within UNDP, how it can become fully integrated into the core of UNDP's operations and functions, and how to contribute our learnings to the broader development ecosystem. The shift from periphery to coreFor experimentation to become institutionalized, it must move from the periphery of innovation teams into the core of programs, policies and decision-making frameworks. This shift can be understood through the lens of norm dynamics(link is external), a concept from international relations that explains how new practices become standard over time.  In norm dynamics, we track the emergence of norms (usually introduced by norm entrepreneurs who advocate for its adoption), to the norm cascade (more teams adopting experimental methods, creating momentum) and finally, internalization – when experimentation becomes widely accepted and expected. One pattern is increasingly clear within the Accelerator Labs Network: experimentation is transitioning from a new, emergent practice to an embedded norm within UNDP. It is referenced in strategic documents, reflected in new partnerships and supported by senior leadership.(link is external) This shift has been actively shaped by the Labs as agents of change (norm entrepreneurs) who have intentionally created the conditions for experimentation to take root. Experimentation within UNDP has passed through its initial stages of emergence, and as more actors within the organization and its ecosystems engage with experimentation as a credible method for addressing complex development challenges, one can argue that we are well into the cascading stage. However, to reach full internalization, experimentation must become an expected and resourced function rather than an optional approach.

Navigating between learning and action, research and implementation, has been crucial to making experimentation both meaningful and actionable. We use the term Feasible Rigor to describe the art of generating robust evidence within the constraints of real-world development actions.

What matters is not perfection, but transparency and learning.In our experience, experimentation involves taking on multiple strategic functions. It is helping to revitalize a forward-looking organizational culture by embedding capabilities such as foresight—illustrated by North Macedonia’s \"Dream Labs,\" where participatory foresight became an official platform for shaping the National Development Strategy. It also plays a key role in de-risking emerging tools and technologies, as seen in Panama, where AI was used to visualize future climate scenarios, helping inform municipal resilience planning. At the same time, experimentation is generating critical insights into complex development challenges—for example, in Paraguay, where different interventions were tested(link is external) to understand their effect on public perceptions of social protection systems. These diverse applications underscore how experimentation supports more adaptive and evidence-informed development.

Crowd-mapping is one such tool initially used for data collection but increasingly recognized for its ability to enhance participation and awareness.In Kenya, herder communities became “water scouts” and mapped over 1,200 water sources and 684 social amenities. In the Maldives, residents mapped island infrastructure to help manage disaster risk. Meanwhile in Guatemala, more than 400 volunteers mapped rural roads using satellite imagery, and a digital tool was developed to assess infrastructure risks from natural disasters using geographic coordinates. In North Macedonia, an open call for crowd-mapping led to the public mapping of water infrastructure in the capital, inspiring civil society organizations like the Scouts Association to replicate the experiment in another city. In Serbia, UNDP used alternative data—satellite imagery, telecom records, and citizen input—to analyze migration patterns, with findings that informed national policy.Experimentation leads to emerging themes in the sustainable development landscapeReflecting on our Network journey and codifying our work, we learned that Labs were not just running individual experiments, they were building interconnected portfolios of work, stitching together themes such as circular economy, climate resilience and inclusive governance. What began as exploratory, one-off experiments have evolved into intentional systemic portfolios, reinforcing the value of experimentation as a method for tackling complex development challenges.

Experimentation as a core elementThe journey from early adoption to full internalization is ongoing. But one thing is clear: with continued commitment, experimentation is no longer just an option for development—it is becoming an expectation.Since 2020, the Labs have developed as a distributed R&D function for UNDP, producing timely, relevant, and localized insights for development programming across 115+ countries. The aim was to try out new ways of working and convert our learnings into new, practical action. The challenge for UNDP and other organizations going forward is clear: How can we ensure that experimentation moves beyond an emerging norm to become an institutionalized standard? To achieve this, we must ensure that experimentation is resourced and expected, not optional; embedded in country strategies and program cycles; and used to inform strategic shifts. As the development landscape grows more complex and uncertain, experimentation offers a path to clarity - not by providing perfect answers, but by asking the right questions, and testing what works - faster. If you are also working on experimentation in the development sector, we invite you to share your experiences, reach out to our network of Experimenters and check out our body of work in the SDG Commons(link is external).", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "From Novel to Norm: Experimentation at the Tipping Point", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_chars": 1603}}

Born in 1898, her cookbooks have sold more copies than the Bible in the country, reaching their 123rd edition, and it got translated into several languages — even Russian.In mid-20th century Argentina, millions of people learned how to use natural gas almost without realizing it. It didn’t happen through technical explanations, instruction manuals, or formal training. It happened through Doña Petrona. She never talked about valves, pressure, or energy efficiency. She taught people how to cook. And in doing so, she was also teaching them how to use a new energy source: natural gas. Making a shepherd’s pie or a homemade flan on live television became, unintentionally, a tutorial on how to light a burner, adjust the flame, or clean the stovetop. This kind of learning — rooted in everyday life and focused on what truly matters — is essential when we talk about technological innovation. Especially when that innovation is tied to basic rights, like access to energy.Between 2016 and 2017, over 4,000 solar water heaters were installed in social housing across the province of Jujuy, potentially reaching up to 16,000 people. These systems were specially designed to withstand the extreme temperature swings of the Puna region, with support from Fundación EcoAndina, an organization working with renewable energy since 1987. The goal was to harness solar energy as a tool to reduce energy poverty. This was a unique project for several reasons: its large scale, the geographic diversity of its implementation —spanning rural and urban areas, both small and large— and the wide range of infrastructure and socioeconomic conditions across the targeted communities. However, beyond the numbers and the magnitude of the logistical effort, the real question wasn’t how many devices were installed, but how many were actually used. \n Renewable Energy: The Work of UNDP’s Co-Lab", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Renewable Energy Lessons From the Kitchen With Doña Petrona", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1983}}

Through surveys with 129 households, 10 in-depth interviews, and one focus group, this research offered firsthand insight into how — or why not — renewable technologies are adopted in contexts of energy poverty.The project Sun at Home: What Works to Adopt Renewable Energy in Social Housing led to a field study whose results we’re pleased to share in this report. One of the main findings was that, despite overwhelmingly positive opinions, the actual adoption of solar water heaters was quite limited: only 7% of households used it as their sole source of hot water, 35% combined it with electric or gas systems, and the remaining 58% didn’t use it at all. You can read the full report here.Among those who didn’t use the system, many never installed it, gave it away, sold it, or fully disconnected it. The reasons were varied: technical issues (like low water pressure, poor orientation that didn’t capture sunlight, or poor installation or substandard materials), unstable water networks, and precarious housing conditions.Yet the biggest obstacle was something else: there was no training or follow-up. The solar heaters were delivered without any hands-on guidance, and the only support offered was a technical manual. As a result, people were left to figure things out on their own — or, at best, rely on neighbors for help. The findings from the Jujuy experience align with others we’ve seen regarding the persistent barriers to the effective adoption of renewable energy solutions. \n Video Player \n What Did We Learn from the Solar Water Heater Experience in Jujuy?", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Renewable Energy Lessons From the Kitchen With Doña Petrona", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1773}}

But for that to happen, you need more than just the technology — you need support. When people don’t understand how the system works, they make do. When the heater is poorly oriented, the water doesn’t get warm. When there’s no pressure, there’s not enough for a proper shower. And when no one explains what to do with the steam during summer, the device becomes a hazard instead of a solution.Even so, some users came up with their own strategies: they came up with fixes like adding drainpipes to relieve pressure and prevent boiling, installed mixers to regulate temperature, cleaned the glass panels to improve heating, adjusted usage times, and shared tips with neighbors. They learned through trial and error — and taught each other along the way.People in Jujuy learned however they could. Back in the day, Doña Petrona had been hired by Argentina’s national natural gas company to promote the shift from wood-burning stoves to natural gas. But she didn’t teach about gas. She showed people how to enjoy life more one recipe at a time.. In the case of solar water heaters, the challenge isn’t just technical — it’s cultural. It’s not enough to hand out devices: you need to be present — to listen, adapt, and truly walk alongside people. You must build trust — not just infrastructure.In innovation processes and in the promotion of new technologies, it’s essential to create experiences where people learn by doing. Ensuring the adoption of renewable energy solutions isn’t just about installing a panel or a solar water heater — it’s about understanding and supporting the routines, knowledge, and habits of those who will use them. In other words, it’s about teaching people how to use them without it feeling like a lesson. Like Doña Petrona.

This practice, which was once guided by ancient codes of honour, has changed over time, turning into violent disagreements, conflict between communities, and the loss of livelihoods. Recognizing the urgency and complexity of the issue, the UNDP South Sudan Accelerator Lab in collaboration with the Roots of Generation (ROG), conducted a follow-up co-creation workshop designed to identify solutions from within the community.The initiative was built on an earlier visit in May 2024, when the Lab, along with staff from the UNDP- Africa Borderlands Centre (UNDP-ABC) and Life & Peace Institute, who had travelled from Kenya and Ethiopia, visited the area. The ABC is UNDP's larger assistance for cross-border peace initiatives in the Karamoja corridor, which includes South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia; a region where national borders are porous, but communities, cultures, and conflict are shared.Our trip back to Narus and Budi was more than just a continuation; it was a connection, strengthening of bonds, sharing of knowledge, and a celebration of local innovation.  \n\n Session with Kraal leaders: Mzee Loraca, during the Co-creation sessions in Narus.

From conversation to design. We led empathy mapping sessions, which used visual aids to analyze the words, thoughts, feelings, and actions of various actors in order to uncover more hidden truths. These conversations with various community groups were incredibly eye-opening. These maps turned into mirrors, reflecting a common burden and strong desire for peace and improved livelihood among the raided families, kraal youths, elders, and women. Communities were able to visualize the overlapping pain points and motivations by mapping the perspectives of local chiefs, mothers, herders, raiders, and even the cattle themselves (a metaphor that provoked both insight and laughter).This exercise surfaced emotional intelligence, the social and psychological effects of cattle raiding. The raided felt depressed, angry, unsettled, and frequently tempted to seek retaliation. They talked about the loss of their young people who were shot in the raids or injured, widowhood, orphanhood, abandoned lands, and the loss of loved ones.

Policies that look solid on paper fail or produce unforeseen side effects. Starting in the 1980s, the science of complex adaptive systems gave us new concepts to talk about these phenomena: “rebound effects,” “feedback loops,” “tipping points,” “phase transitions,” and so on.\nUnderstanding that systems transformation is complex is one thing.

R&D allows for the prototyping of digital tools to scale these initiatives and connect them with the more formal financial system. For example, somebody’s participation in a neighborhood savings group — once digitally recorded — might be accepted by a regular bank as credit history, allowing that person to open a bank account and accessing credit. Early successes in South Sudan and Zambia showed that approaches combining digital technology and proximity networks of trust between neighbors can enhance financial inclusion. The R&D Rave on digital financial inclusion identified promising ways to build on such successes. For example, we discovered low trust in digital financial services, which is likely to slow down their uptake. The Accelerator Labs are considering a global hackathon to explore new ways of creating trust between communities and service providers.\nLearning from R&D on the circular economy: how waste management lays the groundwork for circularity\nUNDP and its Chemicals and Waste Hub take the view that it is no longer possible to separate the ”development and growth” agenda from the “environment and climate” one. Rather, economies must be transformed to incorporate environmental agendas.

This pilot was designed to address the digital skills gap, especially among young women living in peri-urban and rural areas. These skills would not only open job opportunities but also strengthen self-owned businesses and ensure their sustainability.The pilot initiative was launched in the Municipality of Cacuaco, where a selected group of young people, particularly young women, were engaged in a cooperative supported by the AgriPREI Project, where they had access to training in food processing and transformation to start developing capacity to expand business opportunities.Looking at the potential of the cooperative and the youth that had been trained, UNDP came in with the project to provide access to basic digital tools and test a training package that included digital, management, marketing, and entrepreneurship skills tailored to young women in cooperatives. \n\n Figure 3: Storage room converted into a digital learning center, photo by Carlos César", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Empowering the Youth in Rural Areas: Bridging the Digital Divide to Build a Brighter Future", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1489}}

This initiative aims to increase job opportunities and skills for youth involved in agriculture-value chain businesses.The project's activities started with the establishment of a training space, equipped with basic materials to feel like a learning space. The second phase included the co-design of a comprehensive training program through community assessments and workshops including great participation from start-ups and private sector companies that have relevant work and connection with rural youth and the agri-food value-chains. At this stage, the trainers are delivering training to 20 young people, with 80% of them being women. These young participants are gaining essential digital skills, business acumen, and entrepreneurship expertise, setting them on a path towards a brighter future.Learning at the centerWe are approaching this initiative by looking at knowledge, attitudes, and practices, so we did a pre-assessment before the training and will do another one at the end. Additionally, we will also be looking at key hypothesis to test and key learning questions to explore. We will make efforts to explore insights from interviews, human interest stories and journey mapping to have a significant overlapping of information that will eventually be relevant to understand the system and the positive and negative implications of the training program.

Gender-based disparities are evident, with a notable percentage of women not using computers, while men exhibit a more varied distribution in computer usage. In mobile phone skills, women tend to have higher confidence, but both genders exhibit significant gaps in software and internet-related challenges. The gender divide is also felt in the attendance and participation in the training. Many young girls between 19 to 25 years old have month old babies that they need to bring to the class, while others are forced skip training sometimes due to childcare duties. While the pilot does not include dedicated childcare support, in future iterations this is critical to ensure equal access to training. Internet access is a crucial issue, with half of the participants relying on limited mobile data and others lacking access at home or work/school. This underscores the importance of affordable and widespread connectivity. The analysis of gender and technological skills reveals that women excel in specific areas but have fewer diverse skills compared to men. Both genders exhibit shortcomings in advanced skills, underscoring the need for accessible learning resources and support for all.The most common use of mobile phones is photography, with most participants mentioning that they take pictures every day or at least twice a week. Most participants use Facebook daily and some also use Whatsapp often, indicating that they are familiar and comfortable with communication platforms and social networks.

Symposium on Caribbean Arts & Heritage explored how the region’s creative sector is intersecting with A.I., a subject that is shaping discussions among school boards, production crews, libraries and artists alike. The live conversations with subject matter experts revealed a complex environment with challenges and opportunities ahead, many of which clustered around the following key themes that emerged for consideration:  \n\n  The Double-Edged Sword of A.I.Several panelists noted the many benefits that A.I. can bring to the Orange Economy in the Caribbean, including democratizing access to cultural heritage, enhancing arts education capacities and opening new markets for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Many of these positive shifts are already being seen, even if on a small scale. On the flipside, numerous risks were noted - with the potential for A.I. to exacerbate inequalities, further entrench biases, and threaten cultural diversity. From a security standpoint, ethical concerns around data use, privacy, and intellectual property were frequently raised. This resulted in a double-edged sword dynamic requiring proper stewardship to ensure the safe usage of A.I. for creative purposes.  2. Ethics, Equity and Human RightsMany emphasized that any application of A.I. in the arts sector should be firmly rooted in an ethical framework based on human dignity, cultural specificity, and inclusivity. This included calls for a transparent, fair and rights-based approach to A.I. regulation. Additionally, given that A.I. tools are often consumed rather than produced in the Caribbean, it was recognized that A.I. must be anchored in local values rather than those imported externally from global tech hubs. This reflects the reality that dominant A.I. systems typically include Western biases and exclude Caribbean perspectives. As such, there is a need to train A.I. on regional data while also making efforts to protect that data from misu", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Blending Art with Artificial Intelligence in the Caribbean", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1997}}

Governance Gaps and the Demand for Regional StrategyIn Barbados and among the wider Caribbean, A.I. policies are under development, especially when it comes to the creative industries where issues such as deepfakes, voice cloning and unauthorized use of likenesses are prevalent. In this process, there is the distinct challenge of keeping up with the fast speed of A.I. technologies, which are constantly evolving. To address this nascent governance field, regional collaboration was recommended with emphasis on solutions co-designed with grassroots communities, artists, technologists and policymakers alongside institutions such as UNDP, BMHS and ICOM as key partners. This Caribbean-wide approach could together address A.I. policy, digital infrastructure and cultural preservation. \n\n  4. A.I. and the Orange EconomyThe Orange Economy, encompassing economic activities derived from creativity, culture and innovation, is home to specific complexities when it comes to A.I., such as the requirement for protection of intellectual property in music, film, and literature. Several artists underscored the importance of understanding digital ownership, authorship and authentication in the age of A.I., resulting in a strong demand for digital rights and policies that prioritize creators. Additionally, fair compensation for creatives was mentioned and tied to the devaluation of art forms that could occur through A.I., as well as the risks of job displacement posed by emerging tools in graphic design, sound production and editing.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Blending Art with Artificial Intelligence in the Caribbean", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1548}}

Education and Digital Capacity Building  The Government of Barbados is integrating digital capacity-building efforts into the classroom, seen in coding, digital literacy and civics in the curriculum. These efforts are ultimately preparing students for a future deeply impacted by A.I. At the same time, arts education is focusing on critical thinking, responsible technology use and empowering youth to be active creators rather than passive consumers. This also connects to instilling a sense of integrity and ownership among art producers in the A.I. landscape. \n\n  6. A.I. and Heritage PreservationGlobally in the heritage field, A.I. is being used to digitize heritage-based archives, enhance metadata creation and support conservation. The digitization of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), which includes language, rituals, crafts and oral traditions, is a bit more complex, however, as these elements are harder to digitize and protect. Panelists found that A.I. can help document ICH, but that the fundamentals of trust, consent and cultural sensitivity must be established first. To best future-proof these efforts, the significance of open-source tools, distributed storage and non-proprietary formats for sustainability purposes were voiced.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Blending Art with Artificial Intelligence in the Caribbean", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1256}}

Gender, LGBTQIA+ Rights & Digital Safety  Depending on its use, A.I. can amplify marginalized voices or reinforce systemic biases, thus necessitating a stringent approach to regulation and oversight. Concerns around automated harassment, surveillance, and data exploitation were raised. To mitigate these potential pitfalls, panelists recommended intersectionality, community-led safeguards and inclusive data practices in A.I. 8. A.I. in Archaeology & Heritage PreservationIn archaeology, history is meeting modern technology through applications of A.I. to geophysical surveys, predictive modeling and 3D reconstructions of archaeological sites. This presents valuable inroads to repatriation, education, and cultural storytelling. Still, worries about data ownership, community consent and digital colonialism were expressed as worthy of greater attention and investigation. \n\n  9. Call to Action: Local Innovation & Collaboration  Resoundingly heard throughout the panels was a call for the Caribbean to get involved in developing its own A.I. tools while training local talent and shaping global technology narratives. To do so, a push was made for collaboration across sectors, merging government, academia, civil society and creatives together. Overall, A.I. was deemed a transformative opportunity if approached with care, equity, and strategic vision.To watch the A.I.

Adobe Stock \n\n Author\n\n Engy Abdel Wahab\n\n Head of Exploration, UNDP Egypt Accelerator\n\n In the heart of Upper Egypt, where ancient heritage meets untapped rural potential, a quiet revolution is underway. The UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab, in partnership with the Knowledge Economy Foundation (KEF), is spearheading a bold initiative to reimagine tourism—not as a fleeting experience, but as a sustainable engine for socio-economic resilience. Through innovative agrotourism models in Luxor and Aswan, this collaboration is redefining how rural communities engage with tourism, heritage, and development.From Antiquities to Authenticity: A New Tourism ParadigmEgypt’s tourism sector has long been synonymous with its iconic antiquities. But today’s travelers seek more than monuments—they crave immersive, authentic experiences. Recognizing this shift, the UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab has embraced a forward-thinking approach: agrotourism as a catalyst for inclusive growth.Agrotourism blends agriculture, culture, and hospitality, offering visitors a chance to experience rural life firsthand—whether through harvesting sugarcane, learning traditional cooking, or staying in eco-lodges built by local communities. This model not only diversifies Egypt’s tourism offerings but also empowers rural populations, especially women and youth, to become active agents in their own development.The Power of Partnership: UNDP and KEFAt the core of this transformation is a dynamic partnership between the UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab and KEF. Together, they have convened multi-stakeholder roundtables in Luxor and Aswan, bringing together 60+ government officials, entrepreneurs, universities, and civil society to co-design sustainable", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Pioneering Agrotourism in Upper Egypt", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1999}}

The result is a holistic ecosystem where local voices shape the tourism narrative, and where development is rooted in local identity and assets. \n\n Agrotourism in Egypt includes events like tomato drying festivals which celebrate rural life and can generate income. Adobe Stock \n Agrotourism in Action: From Vision to ImplementationThe Accelerator Lab’s methodology, in partnership with KEF, —centered on systems thinking and frontier experimentation—has been instrumental in identifying agrotourism opportunities. Key initiatives include:Mapping Hidden Gems: Aswan University’s Faculty of Engineering is mapping lesser-known cultural and natural sites, from birdwatching trails to heritage villages. These locations are being integrated into digital platforms with QR code storytelling, enhancing visibility and accessibility. This aligns with Egypt’s broader push for cultural tourism, which contributed significantly to the 17 million international visitors in 2024. Such initiatives are part of a global trend: the number of ecotourism destinations has increased by about 8% annually over the past decade. These efforts help reduce over-tourism in popular areas and redirect visitors to lesser known, culturally rich sites.Community-Based Eco-Lodges: Projects like ECO Nubia and Gamandy Eco-Lodge exemplify how local communities can lead sustainable tourism. Built with local materials and managed by residents, these lodges offer authentic experiences while preserving environmental and cultural integrity. In 2024, Egypt saw a rise in eco-conscious travel, with many Red Sea and Upper Egypt accommodations adopting sustainable practices. Globally, 70% of ecotourists prefer to stay in eco-lodges, eco-resorts, or community-owned accommodations.

These figures underscore the economic and social value of projects like ECO Nubia and Gamandy Eco-LodgeAgri-Festivals and Seasonal Tourism: Seasonal events—like tomato drying festivals and sugarcane harvest tours—can celebrate rural life and generate income. These festivals are designed to attract both domestic and international tourists, extending their stay and deepening their engagement. With tourism contributing over $31 billion to Egypt’s GDP in 2023, such niche experiences are increasingly vital for diversifying the tourism economy. Ecotourism trips generate higher economic value, with the average expenditure per trip around $1,200, compared to traditional tourism. Seasonal and agricultural festivals can tap into this premium market, offering immersive experiences that attract longer stays and deeper engagement.Training Rural Hosts: Hospitality and storytelling training programs are equipping farmers, artisans, and home-based entrepreneurs with the skills to welcome guests, share their heritage, and deliver high-quality experiences. This is crucial in a sector that employed nearly 2.5 million people in Egypt in 2023, highlighting the importance of inclusive growth in rural areas. Community involvement is key: 90% of ecotourism operators agree that local participation is crucial for success. Training programs that empower farmers, artisans, and entrepreneurs directly contribute to this model, helping diversify income and reduce dependency on traditional agriculture", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Pioneering Agrotourism in Upper Egypt", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1549}}

Many rural tourism providers operate informally, facing barriers to licensing, financing, and market access. Insights suggest that local authorities and ministries need to work together to simplify licensing procedures, improve rural infrastructure, and formalize informal actors—ensuring that the benefits of tourism are equitably distributed.Moreover, the Lab is championing inclusive development. Women-led initiatives like the Nubian House and Nawaya Egypt’s community kitchens are not only preserving food heritage but also creating dignified livelihoods. Youth are being trained by KEF’s project as digital storytellers, guides, and entrepreneurs, turning their creativity into economic opportunity.Digital Transformation: Storytelling Meets TechnologyInsights recommend digital innovation as a cornerstone in the strategy. From QR code-enabled storytelling to virtual tourism platforms, technology is being harnessed by women & youth entrepreneurs to amplify local narratives and connect rural experiences with global audiences. Development of a digital infrastructure hub—a one-stop platform for training, licensing, marketing, and booking across all tourism value chains, is a key requirement.Toward a Sustainable FutureThe impact of these efforts is already visible. Communities once on the margins of Egypt’s tourism map are now emerging as vibrant destinations. Tourists are discovering the warmth of rural hospitality, the richness of local cuisine, and the beauty of Egypt’s living heritage. And most importantly, rural Egyptians are reclaiming their role as custodians of culture and stewards of sustainable development.But this is just the beginning.

These disruptions demand bold, practical efforts to reimagine how institutions can remain effective, inclusive, and resilient.While incremental adjustments sufficed in stable times, today's complexity demands institutional evolution. This isn't about starting from scratch, but building on what works, shedding what doesn't, and embracing new possibilities. Current approaches are often insufficient for today's challenges, failing to recognize necessary transformations.This calls for rethinking core purposes, structures, and operations. Institutions should become more participatory, integrating diverse perspectives and equitably distributing decision-making. They need to adopt regenerative principles that restore environmental and social systems, and develop resilience to withstand shocks, adapt, and transform. This institutional evolution requires bold leadership, systems thinking, and the courage to adapt established models for a sustainable and equitable future.The 2025 Istanbul Innovation Days (IID2025) (link is external)explored this urgent need. Here, we highlight three key concepts for innovation in development:Irreversibility as a Design Principle: Embedding change for lasting impact.Regenerative Thinking in Institutional Design: Moving beyond sustainability to actively heal and renew.Data, Trust, and Relational Governance: Rebuilding legitimacy through care and accountability.Irreversibility as a Design PrincipleA standout IID2025 workshop, led by Giulio Quaggiotto and Kautsar Anggakar", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Rethinking Institutions for a World in Flux", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

Referring to Buckminster Fuller, he said: “Don’t fight the system. Build a better one that works.” Regenerative non-extractive economic models focus on giving back more than we take - from nature, communities, and future generations. Unlike traditional models that often exploit resources, regenerative models aim to rebuild ecosystems, strengthen local economies, and support long-term well-being. Müller’s principles for regenerative institutional thinking include:Design for Restoration: Restore ecosystems and social cohesion through policies and institutions.Embrace Systemic Thinking: Adopt a holistic perspective, mirroring living systems for integrated solutions.Cultivate the Capacity to Unlearn: Critically examine and discard practices that no longer serve social and ecological well-being.

This shift from sustainability to regeneration signifies deep institutional change. Enduring institutions continuously renew, restore the commons, and prioritize future generations. Müller concluded that nature should be our inspiration for innovation.Data, Trust, and Relational GovernanceIn another powerful session, Kirikowhai Mikaere from Aotearoa New Zealand National Iwi (Tribal) Chairs Forum reminded us that “trust is the currency of data.” As Lead Technical Advisor for the National Iwi Chairs Forum on Māori Data Governance, she challenged the framing of data as a neutral, extractable asset.The Te Kāhui Raraunga Māori Data Governance Model(link is external) asserts Māori authority over Māori data as a taonga (treasure), enabling self-determination and collective wellbeing. Centered on the principle “Data for self-determination,” it offers a values-based approach for public service agencies to govern Māori data ethically and align with Māori priorities. It outlines eight key Data Pou (pillars) covering areas like data protection, access, infrastructure, and workforce development, grounded in principles like accountability, decolonisation, and nurturing data as a sacred resource. The model calls for shared governance, legislative change, and strategic investment to enable genuine partnership and transform Aotearoa’s data ecosystem.Mikaere urged seeing data as a relationship shaped by care, context, and accountability. She highlighted cultural worldviews in governance, with Māori data governance grounded in principles(link is external) such as:Rangatiratanga (autonomy, sovereignty, self-determination or customary leadership)Manaakitanga (ethics of care, respect and inclusive responsibility)Kaitiakitanga (trust, stewardship and guardianship of data for future generations)She stressed that trust must be earned through courageous leadership. \"Trust is", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Rethinking Institutions for a World in Flux", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

And in an insecure and complex world, we need courage, especially the courage to share power.\" Institutions endure not from size, but from trust, care, and collaborative governance.A Shared Horizon: Designing Institutions That EndureIID2025 presented a new vision for public institutions. Themes like irreversibility, relational governance, and regenerative thinking emphasized that enduring institutions require a fundamental shift: designing for lasting relevance, genuine connection and trust, and actively contributing to people and the planet's well-being.Cross-cutting themes deepened this horizon. Sessions on decision-making under uncertainty highlighted human cognition's role. We explored innovative governance roles like Chief Time Officers and Ministries of Loneliness. Conversations on informality and culture underscored that institutions run on relationships as much as rules. Bold provocations included multi-species collaboration, nature-informed intelligence, and strategic development intelligence.ID2025's insights emphasize that creating enduring institutions means evolving how we think, build, and relate. It's about embracing innovative designs that are irreversible in impact, trustworthy in operations, and regenerative in essence. This is the shared horizon: building institutions that thrive and foster a more resilient and equitable future.These ideas offer UNDP Accelerator Labs and Country Offices tangible lenses for navigating complexity. We see potential to apply them in public sector innovation, citizen engagement, and future-skilling. The challenge now is to adopt, localize, and irreversibly embed these concepts within our systems.For further exploration:Institutional Innovation Playbook(link is external)A New Architecture for Public Institutions – UNDP Feature(link is external)IID2025 Conference Recordings(link is external)Let’s keep the conv", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Rethinking Institutions for a World in Flux", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_chars": 1999}}

The question is, who gets a say in making these choices?For the past five years, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network has been actively engaged in participatory data innovation and AI action research throughout Global Majority countries, whether it be through collective intelligence design; through national consultations and dialogues on AI with a wide variety of stakeholders, ranging from government to civil society; or through the use of generative AI to facilitate participatory processes.Following work we did last year with Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) graduate students to design a framework for conducting national dialogues on frontier technologies, we teamed up with our colleagues in UNDP’s Human Development Report Office to consult with and learn from Labs in 16 countries what they had picked up through their work on people’s perceptions of AI. All had concrete, practical experience of engaging with national stakeholders on the topic of AI, whether from government, private sector or civil society.Awareness of AI is growing, but deliberate use and understanding often remains limitedAll Labs reported a general awareness of AI from the many people they interacted with through their work — whether it be through reference to popular applications like ChatGPT, in terms of strategic business or institutional priorities, or simply as a concept. However, many also pointed out a limited depth of technical understanding, of knowledge of when AI was embedded in commonly used systems or applications, or of the concrete possibilitie", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

Some issues raised included low digital literacy and a perception that AI was a “black box”. Additionally, Labs sometimes had to mitigate unrealistic expectations that AI could be applied to almost anything.Most Labs further reported that people, from TikTok content creators in Bangladesh to rural communities in Trinidad and Tobago, generally had mixed feelings about the deployment of AI, with perceptions varying from techno-optimism to considerable skepticism. The Lab in Belarus highlighted a general positivity towards AI, with almost 50% of respondents to a nation-wide survey they conducted reaching 11K people affirming they trusted AI — albeit in most cases, on the condition that they understood how the algorithms worked. The Lab in Trinidad and Tobago mentioned that cautious optimism was often met with healthy skepticism, with 62% of respondents to a survey they conducted in six different locations around the country reaching 211 people mentioning mixed feelings about AI, and a clear divide on whether to trust AI to make decisions that could affect human lives (46% trust versus 42% distrust). Finally, speaking specifically about small shop owners, the Lab in Ecuador stated that people perceived AI as somewhat irrelevant in their day-to-day lives.This is in part due to the challenge of discussing AI as a monolithic technology: it can lead to misrepresentations, unrealistic expectations, and misplaced trust or distrust. There is a dire need for clarity about the possibilities that AI systems can offer, as well as their limitations, in different contexts and for different populations, sectors, and institutions. Conversations about AI need to be situated and based on concrete examples that resonate with people’s experiences.AI-powered drones are being tested by UNDP Zimbabwe’s Accelerator Lab to drive quelea birds into farmer’s nets.

This can lead to insightful conversations about the perceived or anticipated implications of such applications. For example, the Lab in the Ukraine, reporting numbers from the Ministry of Digital Transformation’s White Paper on AI Regulation in the Ukraine, mentioned that 57% of the population were familiar with chatbots; the Lab in Paraguay claimed that civil society often associated AI with targeted ads; and the Lab in Bosnia and Herzegovina evoked some level of public awareness of more specialized applications like AI-assisted radiology and automated customer service. Conversely, the Lab in Guinea stated that individuals with limited digital literacy tended to refer to interacting with AI assistants as “talking to robots,” revealing a fear of not knowing who might be controlling them. Many Labs also reported that people were concerned about AI-facilitated deepfakes and information integrity, data privacy and job replacements or displacements.This suggests that increasing people’s agency over AI is not just a matter of literacy. It is also a matter of demystifying how we collectively refer to and engage with the socio-technical system. This can enable people to seize opportunities, as well as engage in matters of concern and advocate for desirable technological futures.There is not one AI divide, but a multitude of intersecting AI dividesThe Labs highlighted important variations in awareness and understanding of AI, as well as inequities in access and opportunity, within countries and across socio-economic groups. These include geographic divides, for example, between rural and urban areas; generational divides, with younger populations often appearing to be more informed and optimistic about AI; and gender divides, with women expressing less positivity about", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

It is important to critically assess where AI can truly make a positive impact on development, and for whom. Frontier technologies like AI need to be considered from national, and even local perspectives, not just from a global one.In Sylhet, Bangladesh, young social media users (18–29 years) share their hopes, doubts, and expectations around trust, agency, and participation in AI in a focused group discussion. Photo: UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab/Iffat AnjumIncentives behind the development and deployment of AI need to be addressedThe private sector is moving faster than the public sector’s ability to adopt or regulate AI, as many Labs confirmed. Several Labs also discussed infrastructural issues, as well as perceptions of colonial legacy, foreign influence and new dependencies. Others provided a reality check, suggesting that widespread adoption of AI was a distant mirage given the current digital landscape in their countries.For example, the Lab in Panama mentioned that academics thought most about the use of AI for productivity gains in the private sector, as opposed to its deployment in public services; the Labs in Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia noted that data and AI governance was a work in progress in their countries, and that regulations were taking time to be established. The Lab in North Macedonia further pointed out that discussions about AI were mainly driven by business, not by the government or civil society. The Lab in Colombia also shared the view that private companies were shaping the narrative and highlighted that while the country had an Ethical Framework for AI (Marco Ético para la IA), there was a lack of mechanisms for", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1998}}

The Lab in Ecuador further pondered how balancing sustainability with digital growth was a major challenge in the country.These international dynamics between private and public sectors raise important questions about balancing economic incentives — predominantly those of large, Global North conglomerates — and the global public good. There is a need to guarantee that the advantages of AI are distributed equitably, ensuring that those who contribute much of the primary resources such as data also benefit from the economic returns.Towards being more democratic about technologyBuilding trust and enabling greater agency over AI are critical endeavors. As UNDP actively works on re-imagining trust and safety for AI, we remain committed to including a plurality of voices from the Global Majority, as indeed, our collective technological futures should be a matter of choice. To this end, discrete consultations and engagements are necessary, but not enough. They need to be multiplied across all regions of the globe, even in places that may not be particularly AI ready and should be committed to “participation as justice,” i.e., a more continuous, long-term form of engagement that is based on mutual benefits, reciprocity, equity and justice. We encourage you to check out our framework for conducting national dialogues on frontier technologies, and to use it to foster more participation at your level, wherever you are.In doing so, we hope to move away from the paradigm of “democratizing technology” to one of being more democratic about technology.Full list of Labs represented: Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Argentina, Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Trinidad and Tobago, Guinea, Kenya, Morocco, Bangladesh.Methodological note: It is important to note that the insights reported in this blogpost are derived from subjective observations that are based on experience.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_chars": 1999}}

One may experience the city from a place of privilege and enjoyment of its amenities, or from a place of deprivation and survival. Yet regardless of social class, local governments' basic responsibilities are a) to ensure all residents can access city amenities and services efficiently and affordably, b) that those services are citizen-centered, and c) that their voices are heard and included in local decision-making processes.\n\nOne of the most critical issues faced by cities in the developing world is that, as urban sprawl consolidates(link is external), there are persistent local governance issues predominantly in socioeconomically deprived zones. A case in point, in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), there is greater public demand for citizens’ participation in policy decision-making in tandem with a steady decline in public trust in governments throughout the region(link is external), due in part to a collective discontent generated by low participation.\n\nGood governance is fundamental (link is external)for a healthy democracy. Although its meaning and scope are debated and contested(link is external), as a working definition, I conceive of governance as the space of shared power and negotiation between institutions of government and the governed, in pursuit of the collective good. More specifically, for UNDP \"local governance comprises the set of institutions, mechanisms and processes through which citizens and their groups can articulate their interests and needs, mediate their differences and exercise their rights and obligations at the local level.\"", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Urban local governance from the margins:", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1991}}

Most often, a society's lowest strata possess the least bargaining power in making their voices heard. Indeed, UNDP has paid considerable attention to urbanization and inequality, arguing in a report that \"pro-poor urban governance\" is a critical requisite for cities and communities to be livable. For instance, research (link is external)shows that it is among the most economically deprived urban areas where violence and social dysfunction are most salient.\n\nGood governance can nourish a space for local civic engagement that results in positive change(link is external). Yet, social conflict and the struggle for limited resources can jeopardize a community's attempt to find common ground and compromise. In that sense, our ethnographic work in Santo Domingo has been enlightening on the complexities of local governance. While formal governance instruments exist (e.g., neighborhood associations, grassroots organizations, meetings with municipal authorities), community leaders and organizers often complain that their voices go unheard, government commitments unfulfilled, and inner political struggles among local leadership preclude communities from showing a united front on important issues.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Urban local governance from the margins:", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1367}}

Surely, cohesion and peaceful social interactions might be difficult when poverty, the lack of urban planning, overcrowding, and precariousness are some of the salient traits of community life. When conflict arises, even physical violence, it undermines community integration and disperses the social capital available. Social disorganization(link is external) weakens the bonds of solidarity and cohesion. As A. Portes(link is external) contends, the particular social ecosystems of slum neighborhoods are perfectly rational for people who live in marginality.\n\nOur argument here is that sociocultural arrangements and the psychosocial/behavioral repertoire of practices among community leaders and stakeholders influence governance and the ways a community's sociopolitical ecosystem is reproduced. Individuals tend to act according to what the resources and institutional practices permit them. Nonetheless, in our experience, plenty of slum community members(link is external) and leaders work tirelessly and generously for the greater good. Yet their efforts are often jeopardized by the limited social capital and the weak ties of the governance space in their communities.\n\nAddressing local governance problems as development practitioners\n\nAlthough, as AccLab, our problem space is solid waste management (SWM)(link is external), our observations transcend SWM and touch on a wide range of pivotal issues for human development. Local governance is one of those learning experiences worth reporting about.

Many leaders feel used as PR instruments while solutions often remain on paper and rarely implemented. Ensuring they are seen and heard is critical. As a local leader once told me: \"I like working with you (UNDP) because you have been the only institution that takes us seriously in what we say.\"\n Establish neutrality and seriousness of purpose from the outset. Marginalized communities are used to seeing development projects as political mechanisms that generate support in local or national elections. Being perceived as working for one or the other side might slow or put implementation at risk. Further, finding leadership that puts political affiliation aside is necessary for true progress.\n Articulating local governance is a humbling experience for our often stratification-informed perceptions of knowledge and whose opinion matters. As an international development agency whose name carries a certain weight, textbook expertise does not fully prepare us to understand the social world of people at the margins and the subjectivities of their everyday lives.\n Governance is an iterative process. Learning, listening, and understanding diverse (and often contrasting) perspectives among community members means that an idea for a solution is never fixed, even if it was successful.

Le relèvement et le moment où il s’achèvera sont incertains dans un contexte marqué par un cumul de guerre, de tensions politiques mondiales, d’explosion du coût de la vie, de famine, de crise de la dette, de catastrophes climatiques et de recul des progrès dans la réalisation des Objectifs de développement durable (ODD). Le Rapport sur le développement humain 2022 du PNUD décrit avec justesse un ensemble d’incertitudes, où de multiples tensions se renforcent mutuellement et compromettent le développement.\n Depuis plus de trois décennies déjà, le PNUD calcule l’indice de développement humain. C’était la première fois qu’il déclinait dans le monde pendant deux années consécutives. Nous avons été ramenés à 2016, lorsque nous avons commencé à mettre en œuvre les ODD. Personne n’a été épargné. Quatre-vingt-dix des pays ont vu cet indice baisser, une proportion impressionnante. Tous les pays sont confrontés aux incertitudes de l’économie et à l’inquiétude et l’insécurité généralisées. Et nous ne sommes pas au bout de nos peines.\n En dépit de ces obstacles – de leur fait en réalité, devrais-je dire – le PNUD n’a jamais marqué de pause. Partout dans le monde, nos équipes se mobilisent aux côtés des pays en développement partenaires pour aider à endiguer l’évolution de la pauvreté et continuer de faire avancer le développement.

La grande promesse de ce que nous avons commencé à entreprendre fera long feu si nous n’inversons pas immédiatement la tendance à la baisse des ressources de base.

Dans les 46 pays les moins avancés, les ressources de base financent les programmes du PNUD qui luttent contre la pauvreté et les inégalités, s’attaquent aux causes profondes des crises et aident à réaliser la promesse que nous avons tous faite de ne laisser personne de côté. Les ressources de base sont essentielles à notre rôle de conseiller de confiance auprès des gouvernements, comme en ont témoigné de nombreux représentants des États membres lors de notre réunion d’octobre.

Les financements de base entretiennent le travail que nous avons entrepris il y a 30 ans lorsque notre Rapport sur le développement humain a mis en évidence la prédominance du PIB comme indicateur des progrès accomplis. Au cours des dernières années, ce rapport a façonné une compréhension globale de l’orientation de l’humanité, marquant la nouvelle ère de l’Anthropocène, présentant l’«ensemble d’incertitudes » et attirant l’attention sur l’impact brutal de la COVID-19 sur le développement humain.\n\n65.    Parallèlement, notre indice de pauvreté multidimensionnelle, fruit d’une collaboration du PNUD avec l’Université d’Oxford, a permis de mieux cerner l’ampleur et la complexité de la pauvreté et de guider une nouvelle compréhension des solutions. Ces solutions concernent les énergies renouvelables, qui pourraient être l’un des moyens les plus rapides de sortir des privations multiples qui touchent 1,2 milliard de personnes. Toutes ces informations s’ajoutent aux données factuelles qui établissent le rôle indispensable de l’action multilatérale, aidant les dirigeants à plaider en faveur de l’investissement dans les ODD au lieu de se concentrer principalement sur des problèmes perçus comme « plus proches de chez eux ».", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "NULL", "chunk_index": 33, "chunk_chars": 1732}}

Reflecting on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the challenge, it is evident that solutions mapping is effective for engendering innovative solutions to structural issues through collaboration and community engagement.

In particular, the “experience map” and “hypotheses diagram” offered a space where participants could express doubts, uncertainties, failures, or barriers they faced in their initiatives, contextualizing their proposal for their own benefit as well as the facilitators’. This openness created opportunities for ingenuity and constructive criticism among participants, rather than demanding the “airtight” performance of perfect applicants. \nIn future editions, we hope to experiment with formats that incentivize collaboration and synergy among participants.

Specifically, two of the contest finalists were projects that were excluded from the top-5 ranking produced by the expert panel but which received an overwhelming amount of public votes. In addition, the expert ranking produced a tie among three proposals, but the public vote was significantly higher for one of the three, breaking the tie. \nGoing forward, it could be interesting and perhaps valuable to explore and experiment with the expansion of decision-making by using other direct participation methods. This could be achieved perhaps through the inclusion of deliberative assemblies(link is external) with randomly selected community members from participating communities  with or through multiple phases feedback and proposal improvement, integrating institutional or other types of participants in different stages of deliberation and proposal making, furthering even more the diversity of the collective intelligence that emerges from the entire process.  \n\nDespite these limitations, design research methods, mostly centered around qualitative analysis techniques and participatory action research principles, were key to enable a process that was emergent in nature, allowing for enough flexibility and uncertainty to co-exist with the more structured process that we needed to get to concrete winning proposals. Overall, we feel that this experience may represent a good example of an integrated research, development, and innovation cycle that can guide policy for an equally integrated science, technology, and innovation strategic agenda. \n6.

Perspectives on AI Gathered Through Participatory Practices in 16 Countries \n June 11, 2025\n\n  By Jeremy Boy, with inputs from Mirko Ebelshaeuser and Drasko DraskovicThe 2025 UNDP Human Development Report(link is external) posits that making Artificial Intelligence (AI) a driver of human development is a matter of choice. The question is, who gets a say in making these choices? For the past five years, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network has been actively engaged in participatory data innovation and AI action research throughout Global Majority countries, whether it be through collective intelligence design; through national consultations and dialogues on AI with a wide variety of stakeholders, ranging from government to civil society; or through the use of generative AI to facilitate participatory processes.Following work we did last year with Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) graduate students to design a framework for conducting national dialogues on frontier technologies(link is external), we teamed up with our colleagues in UNDP’s Human Development Report Office to consult with and learn from Labs in 16 countries what they had picked up through their work on people’s perceptions of AI. All had concrete, practical experience of engaging with national stakeholders on the topic of AI, whether from government, private sector or civil society.Awareness of AI is growing, but deliberate use and understanding often remains limitedAll Labs reported a general awareness of AI from the many people they interacted with through their work—whether it be through reference to popular applications like ChatGPT, in terms of strategic business or institutional priorities, or simply as a concept. However, many also pointed out a limited depth of technical understanding, knowing when AI was embedded in", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "What do we learn when we listen to the Global Majority on AI?", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

Some issues raised were low digital literacy, limited public understanding of the possibilities offered by AI and that AI remained largely a “black box” for the general public and policymakers. Additionally, there is confusion around certain expectations that AI could be applied to almost anything. The Lab in Belarus highlighted a general positivity towards AI, with almost 50% of respondents to a nation-wide survey they conducted reaching 11K people affirming they trusted AI—albeit in most cases, on the condition that they understood how the algorithms worked. The Lab in Trinidad and Tobago mentioned that cautious optimism was often met with healthy skepticism, with 62% of respondents to a survey they conducted in six different locations around the country reaching 211 people mentioning mixed feelings about AI, and a clear divide on whether to trust AI to make decisions that could affect human lives (46% trust versus 42% distrust). Finally, speaking specifically about small shop owners, the Lab in Ecuador stated that people perceived AI as somewhat irrelevant in their day-to-day lives.This is in part due to the challenge of discussing AI as a monolithic technology: it can lead to misrepresentations, unrealistic expectations, and misplaced trust or distrust. There is a dire need for clarity about the possibilities that AI systems can offer, as well as their limitations, in different contexts and for different populations, sectors, and institutions. Conversations about AI need to be situated and based on concrete examples that resonate with people’s experiences.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "What do we learn when we listen to the Global Majority on AI?", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1932}}

Photo: UNDP Accelerator Labs/Bas Leurs \n Going beyond AI literacy One way to anchor conversations about AI is to pay attention to the specific applications or use cases people refer to, and to use these as proxies for the broader socio-technical system. This can lead to insightful conversations about the perceived or anticipated implications of such applications. For example, the Lab in the Ukraine, reporting numbers from the Ministry of Digital Transformation’s White Paper on AI Regulation in the Ukraine(link is external), mentioned that 57% of the population were familiar with chatbots; the Lab in Paraguay claimed that civil society often associated AI with targeted ads; and the Lab in Bosnia and Herzegovina evoked some level of public awareness of more specialized applications like AI-assisted radiology and automated customer service. Conversely, the Lab in Guinea stated that individuals with limited digital literacy tended to refer to interacting with AI assistants as \"talking to robots,\" revealing a fear of not knowing who might be controlling them.  Many Labs also reported that people were concerned about AI-facilitated deepfakes and information integrity, data privacy and job replacements or displacements. This suggests that increasing people’s agency over AI is not just a matter of literacy. It is also a matter of demystifying how we collectively refer to and engage with the socio-technical system. This can enable people to seize opportunities, as well as engage in matters of concern and advocate for desirable technological futures. There is not one AI divide, but a multitude of intersecting AI dividesThe Labs highlighted important variations in awareness and understanding of AI, as well as inequities in access and opportunity, within countries and across socio-economic group", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "What do we learn when we listen to the Global Majority on AI?", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1998}}

Several Labs also discussed infrastructural issues, as well as perceptions of colonial legacy, foreign influence and new dependencies. Others provided a reality check, suggesting that widespread adoption of AI was a distant mirage given the current digital landscape in their countries.For example, the Lab in Panama mentioned that academics thought most about the use of AI for productivity gains in the private sector, as opposed to its deployment in public services; the Labs in Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia noted that data and AI governance was a work in progress in their countries, and that regulations were taking time to be established. The Lab in North Macedonia further pointed out that discussions about AI were mainly driven by business, not by the government or civil society. The Lab in Colombia also shared the view that private companies were shaping the narrative and highlighted that while the country had an Ethical Framework for AI (Marco Ético para la IA(link is external)), there was a lack of mechanisms for verifying and enforcing compliance. The Lab in Ecuador further pondered how balancing sustainability with digital growth was a major challenge in the country.These international dynamics between private and public sectors raise important questions about balancing economic incentives—predominantly those of large, Global North conglomerates—and the global public good. There is a need to guarantee that the advantages of AI are distributed equitably, ensuring that those who contribute much of the primary resources such as data also benefit from the economic returns.Towards being more democratic about technologyBuilding trust and enabling greater agency over AI are critical endeavors.

Laboratorio de Aceleración de PNUD Argentina/ Head of Solutions Mapping UNDP Argentina Accelerator Lab\n\n ESPAÑOL\n\nHumans have been trying to harness and master energy since the dawn of time. Let’s take fire as an example. Its harnessing was a fundamental milestone in the history of mankind. Fire not only provided light and warmth to protect us from the cold, but also made it possible to cook food, which led to a significant leap in our evolution as a species[1]. Cooking is also part of our culture; it involves establishing habits, transmitting learning, and generating significant memories. Let's now see another historic example: light. Humanity lived most of its history with no light during nights, with the discomfort and risks that this entailed[2].  The mastery of both reflects the fact that energy is a central factor in our quality of life, shaping our daily lives. However, problems related to energy access/distribution are not fully overcome. Many people are left behind.\n\nThe task of mapping territorial energy solutions entails changing the approach and, instead of focusing on large and traditional infrastructure projects, paying attention to how people-centered initiatives are being delivered. Through their identification, we highlight the potential to foster the development of multiple smaller-scale interventions in vulnerable communities to provide solutions that facilitate basic tasks such as: bathing or doing the laundry at a comfortable temperature, lighting or heating their homes, or cooking without indoor smoke, etc. Particularly, these solutions mapping focuses on renewable energy and addresses one of the major challenges of the climate crisis.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "From Conquering Energy to Solutions Mapping: When the Approach Makes Us Human", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1962}}

This is what we learned from these solutions:\n\n There is no one technology that can be applied in every situation. Depending on the situation they are to be used, technologies are either acceptable or not. In some locations with significant levels of solar radiation, solar energy-based solutions may be the natural choice over those that rely on other sources. It is then not surprising that the EcoAndina Foundation(link is external) is developing solar energy-based initiatives in the Puna. Uniqueness is a fundamental element; a device built to be used in one location with a certain level of radiation might quickly become obsolete in another context. Other solutions include harnessing wind energy to convert it into electricity. For example, 500RPM(link is external) stands out for releasing an open-patent wind turbine that can be self-built.\n Whether or not to adapt: Having access to technology does not imply a solution. Habits are equally important. As an example, and from an economic point of view, one may argue that solar stoves save the high cost related to gas for many vulnerable families. Another possibility is that some communities would greatly benefit from having solar stoves since they would no longer spend time gathering firewood, deal with problems associated with carrying it, or risk their health by breathing smoke indoor. However, its deployment requires different adaptations that cannot be taken for granted (cooking times that may depend on weather conditions, cooking outdoors, etc.).", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "From Conquering Energy to Solutions Mapping: When the Approach Makes Us Human", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1626}}

Although technologies and inputs are replicated, there are differences in how the solutions function. It is interesting to see how communities harness them. As a result, a single technology may be used differently according to the local engagement and organization, for instance, when determining what is required.  Women provide a lesson in this sense in the next point.\n Women's roles in energy and gender. Women handle most of the domestic and care duties; in other words, they take care of many tasks  that require energy solutions, such as cooking food and preserving it, doing laundry or taking care of children, etc. Therefore, it is fundamental to consider their opinions. Some researchers did this in a small town in Salta where almost all the men work at high altitudes to earn a living and only the women and children remain in the area. In the summer, they appreciated the moment when they gather to wash their clothes using water basins exposed to the sun (which heat up in a couple of hours), but they dreaded having to do so with freezing water the rest of the year. As a result, a solar-powered community laundry[3](link is external) was created in the town to address what they considered to be an issue.\n Prototypes: From waste to input.  Many technologies were designed as prototypes and some of them were manufactured with recycled materials, waste, or very simple elements.  The use of this type of materials implies the possibility of scaling them at a different speed and being able to involve other communities in their creation. While Liter of light(link is external) uses plastic bottles to provide lighting fixtures. Sun Shower(link is external) uses bottles to install systems that store hot water on the house roofs so that their inhabitants can bathe with hot water.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "From Conquering Energy to Solutions Mapping: When the Approach Makes Us Human", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1843}}

The forms of linkage vary and include iteration in the design of open hardware prototypes, participation in the development of participatory action research projects, participatory management, among others. This interaction entails an exchange of knowledge between people who know their problems very well and others who have technical knowledge that they use in the development of user-centered solutions.\n\nThere is definitely a lot to learn from these solutions. Therefore, at Co_Lab we decided to start a new cycle to further explore this mapping, to experiment in order to gain empirical evidence about what works, and to explore the opportunities and emerging trends related to renewable energies.

So what are we doing to support this ecosystem? For the last four months we have been activating our contacts across the region to find the innovators, the changemakers and the idea-generators to get a better understanding of the growing blue landscape.As part of this ecosystem mapping we explored the trends and projects that innovators have developed, as well as other efforts around climate mitigation, adaptation, building resilience and creating climate solutions. To help with our sense-making initiatives, we also established the Blue Advisory Board made up of several partners from the development and the private sector. Each were asked a few basic questions:What are you doing that’s blue?What have you done that’s blue?What should we not do that’s blue?What should we do that’s blue?This input and dialogue provided a new stream of information and helped us garner and quickly identify a strategic direction for the Blue Lab. We also conducted a “Blue Tour” across the sub-region, engaging with both governments and the general public to gather more collective intelligence on the blue economy and learn from differing perspectives and local ideas. We also hosted a Blue Talk with the University of the West Indies (UWI), which brought together leading innovators to discuss strategies to better support small island developing states in integrating the sustainable development efforts for their ocean-based economic sectors. Additionally, we created the Blue Green Summit which brought together young activists and other local leaders to speak on the issues in the blue economy and to further harness the collective intelligence i", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

We have identified through our partner discussions some key areas of experimentation that are designed to tackle many key challenges and underlying issues that are current in the blue economy arena. At this stage, the below diagram indicates our first four areas of exploration.As part of our new approach, the top line indicates the overarching sectors for further exploration and below are the ideas or concepts that we are looking to test in making the region more Blue!For example:Tourism: We are developing a blue economy badge based on compliance to environmental attainment by piloting the Responsible Tourism Edition of the Oceanic Standards by Oceanic Global. This effort will help us to assess and determine whether sustainable tourism practices help to boost local tourism.Sargassum seaweed: With the increase in sargassum influx to the region over the last 5 years, governments and citizens are exploring ways to manage the increased volumes and find solutions to its potentially damaging effect on coastal ecosystems. In response, with the advent of the single-use plastic ban in Barbados and several other Caribbean countries, the Blue Lab will be working with Oasis Laboratory to pilot a biodegradable alternative to single-use plastic that is made out of sargassum. There are also efforts underway to explore alternative fertilizer solutions made from seaweed.Looking ahead, we can’t give away all our blue brainstorm ideas just yet, but here at the Blue Lab we aim to ensure we support the development of both policy and practice for problem-solving. To this end we will also enter a partnership with the University of the West Indies focusing on “Blue Economists,” an endeavor to marry research and policy and underpin our ongoing regional efforts.The future looks bright blue, and we invite you to", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

Together, these tools provided invaluable insights and empowered participants to refine their leadership approaches, guiding them toward more strategic, confident decision-making. Here Aisha, Ananya, and Vipapone share insights to highlight how the programme has shaped them into confident and strategic leaders.  Building Confidence While confidence is often seen as an inherent trait, for many women in the programme, it was something we had to develop. In a supportive environment, we confronted insecurities and built self-assurance. One participant shared how her initial self-doubt gradually shifted as she became more assertive and develop a firm communication style, both professionally and personally. What began as a leadership development journey evolved into a process of self-discovery, where many of us came to recognize our value, build resilience, and find our voice. The programme didn’t just enhance our leadership skills; it empowered us to challenge the limitations we once placed on ourselves. For many, it was the first step toward leading with confidence.  Mentorship and Strategic Thinking  A key strength of the programme was the pairing of each participant with a senior leader, who along with their guidance also provided strategic insights into navigating the intricacies of UNDP.

This tailored mentorship helped us to refine our leadership approaches, fostering a long-term, strategic mindset.  Networking One of the most valuable aspects of the programme was the peer group structure, which fostered candid discussions, feedback, and the exchange of ideas. More than just a support system, this network became a powerful tool for professional growth. One participant noted that, for the first time, she felt part of a larger ecosystem of women leaders facing similar challenges across the region. These connections transcended national boundaries and individual offices, creating a strong, cross-regional network of women committed to advancing leadership. Growth Through Small Steps Participants learned that significant change comes from small, consistent efforts. Aisha, for example, emphasized how simple practices—such as journaling and seeking feedback—led to meaningful progress in her leadership style. The mentorship programme underscored the importance of patience, reflection, and intentionality, and that small steps can lead to profound transformation. Importance of Diverse Leadership Perspectives  Participants from the Asia-Pacific region expressed a strong desire to learn from women who had successfully navigated similar socio-cultural challenges. This highlights the need for more inclusive leadership development, where gender diversity is accompanied by greater representation of voices from different regions and backgrounds, and reflects the communities it serves and is responsive to their unique challenges.  Engaging Men for Systemic Change  Despite big strides, gender parity challenges persist. In regions where patriarchal norms dominate, women’s voices are often marginalized, particularly in decision-making processes. Even now, some female staff speak of unto", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Leadership Lessons from a Women’s Mentoring Programme", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

This requires creating leadership structures that encourage collaboration and promote equal representation.  ConclusionWhile the Women’s Mentoring programme has successfully strengthened leadership skills and built networks, the journey toward true gender equality is ongoing. While it has fostered personal growth and self-awareness, to achieve sustainable change, we must continue to engage male allies and push for structural reforms that support inclusive leadership. By opening doors for individual advancement, the programme is helping to drive the broader mission of gender equality, leaving participants well-equipped to make meaningful contributions to development work across and beyond the region.  --This blog was co-authored by Aisha Marzuki (Strategic Learning and Visual Designer, UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub), Ananya Filbert (Human Resources Associate, UNDP India) and Vipapone (Tutu) Aphayvanh (Head of Programme Support Unit, UNDP Lao PDR) as well as edited by Cedric Monteiro (Regional Communications Specialist, UNDP Regional Hub)", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Leadership Lessons from a Women’s Mentoring Programme", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1342}}

Photo: UNDP \n\n My journey to becoming a Head of Experimentation and Digital Innovation Specialist at UNDP began, improbably enough, with a childhood fascination with broken radios and electronic devices. Growing up in Luque, Paraguay, I would spend hours taking apart electronics to understand how they worked, much to my parents' frustration when their appliances mysteriously stopped working.This curiosity led me to study electronics in high school, and computer engineering at the National University of Asunción(link is external), where I discovered how technology can help us solve complex problems. While still at University, I worked as a software developer, building systems for the University.  And, while I enjoyed the technical challenges, finding clever ways to work out complicated specs into code, I often found myself wondering about the human side of tech: Who was I really building this for? How and when were they using it? Did it really help or was I giving them more work to do?A Shift Toward Human-Centered TechnologyFast forward a few years, the opportunity came to pursue a PhD in Computer Science, specializing in Social Informatics and Human-Computer Interaction, in Trento, Italy. At the beginning, I was still highly focused on the computer side of systems, but halfway through my PhD, my advisor reached out and said: \"Cristhian, I no longer think your topic is of interest. From now on, I want to study happiness, and how technology can make us all live fuller lives. Care to join me?\"His challenge led me to a 360-degree shift in my career, from one overtly focused on technology, to one more deeply connected to people and thei", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Building Bridges Through Technology and Community Work", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

I started to do ethnographic research in Trento’s senior centers, where I spent over a year helping older adults interact with technology, observing their   struggles with all sorts of information and communication technologies, including a supposedly user-friendly app I had helped design. It was a humbling experience that exposed the pitfalls of assuming we understand users' needs without listening to them first.What started as ethnographic work became a participatory design experience. Spending years co-designing technology with older adults transformed my understanding of research, design and innovation. I learned that no matter how elegant the code, how interesting the tech, how transformative the solution, it is meaningless if it doesn’t start with the needs, prioritizing the lived experiences of real people.

Photo: UNDP \n Another milestone that I’m proud of was my contribution to the Public Innovators Program. This capacity-building initiative was designed to empower government officials with the skills and knowledge needed to lead innovative efforts in public service. We focused on training civil servants in human-centered design, equipping them with tools to research, design and develop pilot projects that addressed pressing public service and policy challenges. The success of this program, which gained traction and secured funding from multiple partners, has been one of the most fulfilling parts of my journey within UNDP. It made me realize that the capacities we were bringing to the organization were needed across the system, and to develop them had the potential of creating a ripple effect that would lead to more sustainable, citizen-driven solutions. One last culminating rewarding moment happened during a detail assignment in Bhutan. I was tasked with coordinating and co-facilitating one of the Accelerator Lab’s codification fests, which gave me the chance of working closely with experimenters in the network in identifying and documenting our shared practices.

The positive feedback from my colleagues, especially the head of the lab who told me my remarks were “so on point,” was incredibly rewarding, and it not only deepened my connection with my peers but also reinforced the value of grassroot innovation and the participatory approaches we were championing through our work, reminding me of the power of community engagement and cultural sensitivity.Embracing Challenges and Lifelong LearningLooking back to these years at UNDP, I can now see how my background as an academic researcher has significantly enriched my work by giving me a solid foundation in research, design, and innovation methodologies, critical thinking, and evidence-based problem-solving. The ability to analyze complex social issues through the lens of technology and innovation has been invaluable in navigating development challenges. At the same time, these 5 years at UNDP meant for me to go deep into themes that were foreign to me, coming from a more technology-focused career. Each new challenge brought a lifelong learning opportunity to me, and this was one of the most exciting parts of my time at UNDP. In the past 2 years, however, I started to transition back  into the technology-intensive themes, as I became the Digital Advocate of our country office, allowing me to reconnect with my technical roots, crafting initiatives that harness technology for social good, integrating global capacity building offerings, like the Digital Fitness Program and the Data to Policy Workshop into the mix of training programs we facilitate for staff and government officials.So many other experiences shaped my journey during these 5 years.

It has been shaped by curiosity, by moments of doubt, by unexpected detours, and by the belief that technology should serve people, not the other way around.What excites me most about the future is the unknown. The problems we face as a global community are complex, but I have seen firsthand how research, development and innovation, when rooted in human connection and experiences, can drive real change. Whether it’s empowering informal waste collectors, mentoring young students, or collaborating with policymakers, I have learned that solutions don’t emerge from algorithms alone, they emerge from listening, from experimenting, and from embracing the messy, unpredictable nature of real-world challenges.For young professionals aspiring to make an impact, my advice is simple: say yes. Say yes to challenges that scare you, to opportunities that push you beyond your expertise, to the chance to make a difference, however small it may seem. Because often, it’s those small, unexpected moments that lead to the biggest transformations.As I continue my work with UNDP, I carry with me the stories of the people I’ve met, the lessons learned in the field, and the belief that technology, when designed and wielded with empathy and purpose, can help build a more just, sustainable, and inclusive world.

Horizon scanning  – the practice of observing and capturing signals of change – once an experimental side practice, has steadily grown into a core activity — shaping conversations, informing strategic planning, and cultivating a culture of future-consciousness across the office. Despite its momentum, a key challenge persisted: how to make horizon scanning actionable for colleagues in programme delivery. While signals helped teams consider the future, their connection to daily project decisions often felt abstract—helpful in theory, but difficult to apply practically. Recognising this gap, the Country Office set out to build a clearer bridge between foresight and implementation. Through three workshops, the team piloted a stress-testing process on its Circular Economy portfolio— linking emerging signals to specific interventions within the portfolio’s three pivots. In doing so, they moved foresight from the realm of the conceptual to the practical— providing tools to inform decisions, challenge assumptions, and improve strategic alignment.What emerged was not just a refined portfolio, but a renewed sense of what foresight can be: a practice that is rigorous, grounded, and accessible—even to sceptics.

Tum Nhim, Head of Solutions Mapping at UNDP Cambodia Accelerator Labs \n The Process: Stress-testing the Circular Economy Portfolio The Circular Economy (CE) portfolio in Cambodia is structured around three strategic pivots: enabling government leadership, nurturing circular business and market growth, and cultivating conscious consumers and citizens. Each pivot is anchored in a core intent—ranging from strengthening the state’s capacity to champion CE reform, to mainstreaming inclusive business models, to fostering public awareness and engagement. The first phase focused on a targeted horizon scanning effort, which has already become second nature to the Cambodia CO. Beginning with an initial horizon scanning workshop in 2021, followed by a series of sense-making and scenario-building exercises throughout 2022, the CO developed its new Country Programme Document (CPD) for 2024–2028 with a distinctly futures-oriented lens. This journey culminated in the development of a Foresight Playbook tailored to the CO’s context—offering tools and prompts to embed strategic foresight across project cycles and institutional workflows.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "From Signals to Systems", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1437}}

First, they prioritised themes relevant to the Cambodian context and then, they introduced a second dimension: the degree of uncertainty. Assessing signals and themes across both these dimensions enriched the dialogue about forces shaping the future—those we understand and can plan for, and those with ambiguous implications. By classifying themes along these two axes, the team could differentiate between “known certainties” that required immediate strategic alignment and “relevant uncertainties” that warranted more flexible, anticipatory responses. \n\n The Relevance-Uncertainty matrix to identify the more critical but still uncertain themes \n\n Each intervention was assessed for how directly it addressed each theme that emerged— using a green, yellow, or red traffic light system. \n\n The next phase involved mapping the Circular Economy portfolio against the “relevant and certain” trends.

Each intervention was assessed for how directly it addressed each trend— using a green, yellow, or red traffic light system.This participatory mapping revealed critical insights. For example, in Pivot 2, the team found significant private-sector skepticism about circular business models.

The risk was clear. Without adequate in-house expertise, the transition could stall at the policy level, leading to regulation that was either delayed, ineffective, or poorly enforced.

The signals collected raised questions about the real-world viability of Circular Economy business models and whether the ecosystem—financial, regulatory, and technical—was equipped to support their transition.ActionRather than abandon ambition, the team reframed their approach. They recognised that evidence speaks louder than advocacy. If private sector buy-in was essential, then proof points were needed—demonstrations of what works, under what conditions, and with what trade-offs. The roadmap was therefore restructured to prioritise ideation, prototyping, and incubation of circular business models. These would serve both as vehicles for innovation and as platforms for building confidence in the economic promise of circularity. \n\n Pivot 3: Conscious Consumers and Active CitizensInsightThe third pivot focused on the role of the public—not just as beneficiaries, but as drivers of change. However, the foresight process revealed that while climate change and environmental issues were gaining visibility, the specific value proposition of the Circular Economy remained poorly understood. There was a real risk that CE would be conflated with generic green initiatives, diluting its distinctiveness and undermining the effectiveness of communication campaigns.ActionThese reflections informed a strategic rethinking of planned interventions, ensuring that the portfolio supported both circular and green transitions. Communication strategies were recalibrated to better distinguish CE from broader environmental narratives, while outreach efforts were repositioned to emphasise practical, relatable entry points for the public.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "From Signals to Systems", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_chars": 1786}}

For many colleagues in the Country Office, this was the first time foresight felt truly accessible. In contrast to earlier horizon scanning exercises, which had helped develop a shared future-consciousness at the programme level, their influence on daily work at the project and portfolio levels often remained implicit—absorbed rather than applied. This time, something shifted.By directly linking trends and signals to the practical challenges that colleagues were facing in projects and portfolios, the workshops made foresight feel less like an abstract strategic exercise and more like a concrete way of working. Colleagues across the office, particularly those deeply engaged in programmatic delivery, began to view foresight not as a parallel function managed by the Accelerator Lab, but as a toolkit for making better decisions in real time.“These workshops really changed how people viewed foresight,” noted Tum, Head of Solutions Mapping at the Accelerator Lab. “Six months later, I was in a meeting with government partners, and to my surprise, it was our economist colleagues—the ones who are usually more inclined to the rigour of quantitative methods —who brought up the foresight stress-testing tools. They said the tools are very practical, structuring qualitative insights in a way that made them usable for government partners. That was a big moment for us. A small win, but one that showed just how deeply this approach had landed.”As teams engaged in mapping the initiatives across the three pivots—government leadership, private sector transformation, and consumer engagement—they also began to see the invisible threads that wove these efforts together. What initially appeared as discrete domains soon revealed themselves as deeply interdependent.

Horizon scanning can easily become a box-ticking exercise if the team only focuses on known and local signals—policy dialogues, donor priorities, and sectoral needs already in play. This risks reinforcing existing assumptions rather than challenging them. For future iterations, the team considered designating a “Red Team” responsible for identifying counter-signals and emerging disruptions from regional and global contexts—ensuring that the foresight process doesn’t become a mirror of what we want to see but a window into multiple possible futures.Additionally, special care needs to be taken in facilitating this discussion. As expected, teams were often inclined to overrate their interventions, shying away from red flags. Introducing gamification—framing the task as “the team that can find the most red lights wins”— can prove helpful in shifting the mindset from defensiveness to curiosity. It also highlights the critical role of facilitation in foresight work, particularly in creating space for self-reflection and constructive critique.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "From Signals to Systems", "chunk_index": 7, "chunk_chars": 1214}}

The ambition extends beyond internal use. The team sees potential in sharing these tools with government counterparts, as the approach is practical and accessible.

Preguntas de Aprendizaje sobre Digitalización y MIPYMESExplorar estas interrogantes es fundamental en un contexto en el que la aceleración de las tecnologías digitales plantea tanto oportunidades como desafíos. Las empresas que logran integrar herramientas digitales suelen ser más competitivas, pero no todas las MIPYMES están en igual nivel de preparación para afrontar esta transformación. El nuevo ciclo de aprendizaje del AccLabPY aborda la Digitalización y las MIPYMES desde nuestra metodología de I+D participativa, aplicada al desarrollo sostenible. Nuestro ciclo empieza con el descubrimiento y exploración de en qué medida las MIPYMES de un territorio están preparadas para aprovechar las oportunidades que brinda la digitalización. En este blog post, resumimos algunos hallazgos de la primera etapa de esta exploración, en la que aprendimos que la digitalización puede generar beneficios clave, como la expansión de redes sociales, la eliminación de intermediarios y una mejor accesibilidad al crédito(link is external). Al mismo tiempo, existen oportunidades tentadoras para la formalización de empresas informales a través de la digitalización, como lo ha demostrado la experiencia en otros países. Ahora, el reto en Paraguay es explorar en qué medida las MIPYMES están listas para este cambio y qué herramientas pueden potenciar su desarrollo.PREPARACIÓN, ADOPCIÓN Y MADUREZ DIGITALEste ciclo se enfoca tanto en la adopción tecnológica, como también en comprender las diversas formas en que las MIPYMES pueden alcanzar la madurez digital, adaptándose a un entorno cada vez más dinámico. Modelos como el de Aceptación de Tecnología (TAM) o el de Tecnología-Organización-Ambiente (TOE) que revisamos en la etapa de preparación nos ayudaron a delinear herramientas de diagnóstico para evaluar la adopción de tecnologías digitales en este sector clave de la economía.La Preparación Digital (Digital Readiness) se refiere al grado en que una MIPYME está lista para implementar te", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "¿Qué tan preparadas están las MIPYMES en Paraguay para la transformación digital?", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1998}}

La aceptabilidad está relacionada con factores como la facilidad de uso de las herramientas, la formación y la percepción de beneficios.La Adopción Digital (Digital Adoption) se refiere al proceso mediante el cual una MIPYME incorpora y utiliza herramientas y tecnologías digitales en sus operaciones diarias. Esto puede incluir la adopción de software de gestión, plataformas de comercio electrónico, redes sociales y herramientas de análisis de datos. La adopción exitosa implica no solo la implementación de estas tecnologías, sino también su uso efectivo y continuo por parte de los empleados.La Madurez Digital (Digital Maturity) describe el nivel de desarrollo en el uso de tecnologías digitales dentro de la empresa. Un modelo de madurez digital puede evaluar aspectos como la tecnología y habilidades digitales; el uso de datos y analítica; la comunicación y canales de venta; los procesos; y el modelo de organización y personas Luego de explorar la literatura existente para medir niveles de madurez digital, identificamos la herramienta de autoaplicación denominada Chequeo Digital(link is external), desarrollada por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, que ya se ha implementado en varios países de la región y estaba todavía con poca adopción nivel local. Nos aliamos con universidades de cinco departamentos y siete Centros de Apoyo al Emprendedor, para aplicar esta encuesta en forma amplia, y contar con más datos que permitieran entender los desafíos. Así, este ciclo de aprendizaje representa una oportunidad de entender mejor las necesidades digitales de las MIPYMES y de contribuir a su fortalecimiento, apoyando la creación de un entorno más inclusivo y sostenible para el futuro de Paraguay.ALGUNOS HALLAZGOSAsí como la vendedora de ensaladas", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "¿Qué tan preparadas están las MIPYMES en Paraguay para la transformación digital?", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_chars": 1999}}

Recently, I attended and co-facilitated  a workshop at the request of our Sustainable Environment Management, Energy and Resilience (SEMER)(link is external)  team, that brought together young minds from across Namibia to discuss and develop solutions for climate change. The experiences and insights gained from this event have inspired me to share some key takeaways and suggestions for our youth as they step into their roles as advocates for climate change.The Power of Networking and ExposureOne of the most significant observations from the workshop was the need for better and intentional networking among the youth. Exposure to events, workshops, and conferences can elevate the level of innovative solutions around grassroots innovation and local indigenous knowledge. Hence, there is a need for platforms to connect like-minded individuals, experts and young people to exchange ideas, learn from each other, and collaborate on projects that address climate change in meaningful ways.Creating Communities of PracticeRelated to networking and exposure, and to foster knowledge sharing and learning, it is also essential to create communities of practice. These communities could serve as platforms where youth can come together to discuss challenges, share successes, and learn from each other's experiences. These networks create safe learning spaces to ensure that valuable knowledge and innovative solutions are disseminated widely and effectively.Chat", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Embracing Innovation and Climate Action: A Call to Namibian Youth", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1999}}

While I am a cautious advocate in embracing artificial intelligence (Ai), the reliance on large language models (LLMs) to developing solutions has to be accompanied by moving beyond what the model generates. The pitch session revealed that some solutions presented were typically Ai- Generated, which left me feeling that those presentations were devoid of context and personalization. To create impactful and relevant solutions, we must encourage our youth to delve deeper, contextualize their ideas, rely on the wisdom of their peers and infuse them with local knowledge and personal experiences.Embracing Creat-a-thons and Nature-Based SolutionsOne exciting way to foster innovation is through organising create-a-thons.  These are intensive, collaborative events where participants brainstorm and develop solutions in a short period. Additionally, nature-based solutions using biomimicry can offer sustainable and effective ways to address climate challenges. The work of our Accelerator Lab Colleagues in UNDP Ukraine and UNDP South Africa has shown that  looking to nature for inspiration, we can develop solutions that are both innovative and environmentally friendly.Encouraging Experimentation and CuriosityExperimentation and curiosity are the bedrock of innovation. We must encourage our youth to be curious, to ask questions, and to experiment with new ideas. Our UNDP Accelerator Lab in Panama(link is external) as well as Argentina(link is external) have embedded the use of Artificial Intelligence and citizen science to foster a culture of curiosity, experimentation and continuous learning. This is necessary for us to unlock the creative potential of our young people and drive forward-thinking solutions for climate change.Contextualizing Climate Change to NamibiaOne oth", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Embracing Innovation and Climate Action: A Call to Namibian Youth", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

Our country faces unique challenges, and our solutions must reflect our local realities. There is a need for us to align climate messaging with issues such as unemployment and resource inequality so that we can foster ownership and action.Using Social Media WiselySocial media is a powerful tool for advocacy, but it must be used wisely and intentionally. Instead of merely following influencers, our youth should use social media to share their stories, raise awareness, and mobilize action. The term “Be found doing” is a mantra that we have come to adopt as both inspiring and a call to action.  This mantra helps us embrace the need to actively engage in climate action and share efforts online, creating a snowball effect so that other young people can inspire others and create ripples of positive change.Holding Space for Each OtherOne of the most heartwarming moments of the workshop was witnessing how the youth held space for a young gentleman who stuttered but managed to communicate his message from the heart. This act of kindness and support exemplifies the hope for the future and for Namibia. It reminds us that, together, we can create a supportive and inclusive environment where every voice is heard and valued.Hope for the FutureThe workshop left me with a profound sense of hope for the future. Our youth are ready to lead, and they have the passion, creativity, and determination to drive meaningful change. By supporting them, providing opportunities for networking and learning, and encouraging innovation and experimentation, we can empower our young people to become champions of climate action.The future of Namibia lies in the hands of our youth.

When UNDP can show it has a solid foundation with core money, this encourages other organizations, charities, and even businesses to pitch in with more specific funding, multiplying our work’s impact.Trying New Ideas: Core funding allows UNDP to experiment with innovative solutions to development challenges, like our \"Accelerator Labs\" that explore new approaches and solutions. It also supports important research, and reports that shape global thinking on development.Keeping Things Running Smoothly: This flexible money also underpins UNDP's global network of offices and staff, allowing them to provide on-the-ground support to governments and work efficiently within the broader UN system.

A country rich in history, culture, and natural beauty had long been overshadowed by years of conflict and isolation. But change is in the air. The narrow streets of Tripoli’s Old City are once again buzzing with life, motorsport enthusiasts are gathering in the Sahara, and—perhaps most tellingly—the world is starting to notice. With the recent launch of Libya’s e-visa system, the country is taking concrete steps to open its doors to international visitors. This signals a renewed commitment to welcoming the world and reclaiming Libya’s place on the global tourism map.From the cobbled alleys of Al-Madina to the golden dunes of the Great Sand Sea, Libya is slowly but surely stepping back onto the global tourism stage, driven by grassroots initiatives, a spirit of adventure, and an unexpected group of ambassadors—foreign social media influencers.  \n\n UNDP Libya /Abdullah Hussein", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Libya’s Tourism Revival", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1290}}

Today, a renewed sense of pride in this heritage is taking root. The ongoing restoration of Tripoli’s Old City(link is external) is a symbol of this revival.  Once neglected, its whitewashed buildings, historic mosques, and vibrant souqs are now being carefully restored, turning the district into a cultural hub. Visitors can sip Libyan tea in the centuries-old courtyards or explore through artisan workshops nestled between stone walls.Cultural festivals are reactivating public spaces. Music spills from hidden courtyards. Local artists are painting new life into old walls. Landmarks like the Karamanly House Museum, once a crumbling relic, now stand proudly as a window into Libya’s past. This isn’t just about preserving history—it’s about making it part of everyday life again. International travel influencers also play a role through videos capturing the majesty of Sabratha’s seaside ruins(link is external).

Among them, tourism stands out as a powerful opportunity for sustainable development and job creation. Using the Three Horizons strategic foresight approach, UNDP’s Accelerator Lab facilitated a collaborative process with government counterparts to envision the future of tourism in Libya.  Over the course of two months, the Lab introduced the methodology and trained Ministry teams on how to apply this method across various industries, including tourism, which emerged as a sector with significant potential for Libya’s future growth. This engagement culminated in the  “Café of Innovation and Ideas event: an interactive policy dialogue that brought together 65 participants from the government, private sector, academia, civil society organisations and youth leadership. In the tourism-focused session, participants mapped out Libya’s current tourism in Libya. Over the course of two months, the Lab introduced the methodology and trained Ministry teams on how to apply it across different sectors. Key challenges were acknowledged: limited infrastructure, outdated policies, and the need for greater security assurances.  However, the conversation quickly turned to opportunities. Ideas such as promoting Libya’s landscapes to filmmakers, developing tourism-focused mobile apps, and producing adventure tourism documentaries emerged as feasible next steps. The vision for the future was ambitious: A strong national tourism strategy.

Although co-design methodology is very well known in urban design spheres globally, it has never been widely adopted in Turkey. AccLab Turkey contextualized this as a process of learning and sharing experience with the stakeholders.Ghost space is a term to describe underutilized or abandoned public spaces in an urban area. The primary cause of ghost spaces is poor design that lacks the attraction of place, safety, perceived safety, environmental quality, and accessibility. In some cases, ghost spaces are dilapidated but collectively memorized public areas which are deeply connected to the vivid narratives of people. However, today, ongoing political impositions and spatial interventions might serve to wipe away the collective understanding of what a public space is or should be in urban life.In its broadest definition, a public space is a place that is open and accessible to people. It encourages collectivism, action, demonstration, and creation of discourse via interaction. Indeed, it manifests the spirit of a city with its physical form and social fabric. By this mean, the placemaking practices supports creating dynamic, healthy urban environment, improves urban infrustructure, social networks, and safety when they are conducted with transparency and good faith from bottom up. The process requires strong local partnerships, participation of diverse existing groups and NGOs working collaboratively that results in enriching the value of identity, public demand, and recognition.AccLab Turkey aims to encourage exercising o", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "Pandemic and Ghost Spaces", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 2000}}

The pandemic has intensified discussions on eco-living, digital infrastructure, smart cities, internet technologies and the use of big data. We need to reconsider how as human beings we occupy the Earth to find new ways to improve environmental and social sustainability. If these new conditions persist, we will need to consider novel approaches to living and infrastructure, such as moving towards decentralized cities and redistributing some of the population to rural settlements thanks to today’s remote working capabilities.Among many other responses, actions and recovery scenarios, discussions about the future speculate about new terms of sociality - beyond the end of the pandemic, and what life might look like.

So, the days when we will question spatiality are not far away.  We are all faced with an immersive need for digitalization in doing business, communication, and networking. Discovery of digital tools to maintain projects, meetings and programmes has become essential. Almost all communities and human relations have been moved to online platforms. Many art and science institutions have started sharing their archives online and have found ways to offer virtual access to their events and activities to stay connected.Even so, we can't technically claim those digital platforms as virtual public spaces, we don't pay much attention to the absence of public space online due to the ad-hoc nature of the internet: no zoning restrictions, no city plans or elected authorities. Yet they provide various tools to maintain some of the functions of public spaces such as participation, diversity, collective decision making, co-creation, and production of discourse.From this point of view, the ghost space project can still grow online in collaboration, participation and digital tools considering it as an experiment on its own. Online tools enable co-working, organization of events, workshops, and collective decision making. Therefore, we see a value-added opportunity in communicating via online platforms which permits the tracking of changing needs, perceptions, and futuristic perspectives through new living conditions.

Such tasks help us provide UNDP with an understanding of how global trends and cutting edge issues might potentially affect current policy and practices in the near future.\nLet me walk you through how this is done in practice through a real-life example from our work at UNDP Colombia(link is external)’s Accelerator Lab. In Colombia, we have chosen to focus our work on vulnerable populations, because in our country there are many developmental gaps — what we call “hotspots”(link is external) — in terms of poverty, migration, gender inequality, violence.\nHow do you solve a problem like migration?\nSince 2015, Colombia has attracted more than 1.6 million Venezuelan migrants, of which more than 50 percent are in irregular conditions or without proper documentation(link is external) (R4V, 2019). Experts say the trend of displacement is not going to change any time soon and that the majority of migrants will stay in Colombia for the long-term.

But how does one go about that? For me, exploring means taking a complex challenge like migration and approaching it in an open-ended way. It includes researching all related data and understanding how other countries have addressed this issue, so that we at the Accelerator Labs can apply what works to Colombia. Our theory of change is that, if we thoroughly understand a hotspot such as migration, we might be able to manage its effects and transform it into a development opportunity.How does “exploration” work?\nWe start with desk research, identifying relevant case studies, stakeholders and potential new data sources. The desk research helps us to identify patterns, unforeseen opportunities and collect under-the-radar insights around how to address a broad topic like migration. Some of these insights might not be obvious at first glance, or may run counterintuitive to our common understanding.\nFor example, in my exploration, I found that the most recurrent strategies are humanitarian and economic inclusion responses (providing access to basic services, shelter, employment, skills training, entrepreneurship programmes), perhaps because these issues are the easiest to observe and address for most programme specialists. But a counterintuitive insight may be that migration challenges also relate to migrants’ motivations and behaviors — for example, the desire of a migrant to feel free, to be recognized and to be culturally understood in a new country.\nAdditionally, mapping out case studies helps us to broaden our solutions spectrum by giving us new ideas on how to tackle migration using new technologies, changing narratives, and gathering unconventional data like emotional analysis from social media scraping.\nNext step: Bringing insights together", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "What we talk about when we talk about “Exploration”", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1854}}

Migration is usually seen as a process of adaptation, but what happens if we start seeing it as a person’s right to freely choose to stay home or migrate to a new place of residence?\nIn this way, we analyze migration not just from diverse angles — political, social, economic and so on — but also from the viewpoints of diverse observers — urbanists, ethnographers, public officers, lawyers, migrants, host communities and development actors. This brings inclusivity to our insights but also adds value by bringing in new learnings and untraditional ways of thinking that we have not necessarily seen before.\nAt the same time, foresight exercises create possible futures starting with the identification of current trends or disruptive events that are related to migration and the exploration of direct and indirect implications of these events. For example, a global trend is that migration caused by climate change might be one of the biggest reasons why humans migrate in the near future. So, having a forward-thinking mindset can allow decision makers to take accurate actions in the present to positively affect future outcomes.\nAs you can see, we employ these various methods to be able to explore an emerging issue from multiple angles, which lead us to new — and often unexpected — findings.Beyond exploration: Completing our learning cycle", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "What we talk about when we talk about “Exploration”", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1769}}

For example, one of the recent insights we had is that it’s easier for migrants to establish themselves in a new country when they have an existing social network in Colombia rather than when they come by themselves, as that first contact allows them to navigate the territory and public services. Another insight is that migrants are being absorbed by the informal economy in Colombia.

With this experiment we set out to identify and measure biases towards “otherness.” More specifically, our first measure was looking at the biases of urban populations towards left-behind hotspots and their inhabitants served by UNDP projects. In this augmented reality experience, each participant had access to 10 pictures, each one part of relevant UNDP initiatives. When a mobile device with the app was pointed at the photograph, a video popped up, telling the human story behind the project. Our aim is to run the experiment in other regions of Colombia and other targeted groups, to collect results and create new knowledge about behavioral science, the use of technology and reducing mental gaps as a path to reduce development gaps. Running experiments such as “Augmented Development”(link is external) allows us and our partners to succeed or fail fast and learn to scale multiple and integrated solutions in parallel from a systemic point-of-view.\nOur learning journey has just started, so stay tuned to see the results that will follow.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "blogs", "source_filename": "blogs.csv", "title": "What we talk about when we talk about “Exploration”", "chunk_index": 4, "chunk_chars": 1382}}

The ministry is the largest of the province, and the province it self is the most populous in the country, accounting for approximately 38% of the national population.

The goal was to detect key inefficiencies such as fragmentation, overlapping functions, and outdated procedures, and to assess whether the proposed One-Stop Shop model could enhance access, optimize the use of resources, and better serve those most in need. This process entailed a clear problem definition, ecosystem mapping, and narrowing the scope for targeted action.\n\nWhat is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....\nThis study was exploratory in nature. Therefore, it sought to understand which factors hinder or facilitate the reception of requests. The main hypothesis planned to be tested was that processes for receiving applications affect their registration and monitoring and consequently limit the Ministry's ability to evaluate the outcomes of the policies designed to address the identified problems. In addition, we wanted to test if the lack of standardization in internal procedures generates inefficiency and inequity in the handling of requests and if weak coordination between municipal departments and with external actors (NGOs, national agencies, etc.) limits the comprehensive resolution of cases.    \n\nWhile this study is exploratory in nature and does not seek to establish statistical causality, it is guided by a set of working hypotheses. These hypotheses serve as an analytical framework throughout the report, helping to organize findings, highlight key areas of concern, and inform the direction of proposed actions \n\n- The absence of standardized processes for receiving requests may lead to inconsistencies in how they are registered and monitored, weakening the Ministry’s ability to track and respond effectively.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "experiment_platform", "source_filename": "experiment_platform.csv", "title": " A Place for Your Voice: First Steps Toward a Citizen Request Center", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1928}}

Based on a sensing or understanding exercise conducted jointly by the ministry and UNDP teams, along with interviews with key stakeholders and process analysis, the main findings included: \n\n- Multiplicity of intake channels: Currently, three main areas (Modernization, Carla Zocco’s team, and the Minister’s pre-private office) manage requests independently, without coordination or integrated systems. As a result, the intake and processing of requests are fragmented, often leading to duplication of tasks and of the same requests. \n\n- Outdated tools: Requests are recorded in various shared Excel spreadsheets, limiting the ability to track cases, causing duplication, and hindering access to consolidated information. There is also no unified database among the different areas, which impairs more strategic and evidence-based decision-making.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "experiment_platform", "source_filename": "experiment_platform.csv", "title": " A Place for Your Voice: First Steps Toward a Citizen Request Center", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1985}}

This leads to a lack of long-term planning within the areas. \n\n- Reliance on informal tools: WhatsApp and personal email accounts are the main channels for internal and external communication. This limits knowledge and analysis regarding the number and processing of requests, and also poses risks to data security and traceability of citizens’ information. \n\n- Staff shortages and operational overload: The volume of requests exceeds the processing capacity of the current teams, who face insufficient technological resources — often using personal computers — and limited human resources.\n\nWhat are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment?

This project will have clear consequences on the day-to-day job of bureaucrats, redesigning the process on how requests are received, classified, and derived. The day-to-day bureaucrats in the Ministry attend unexpected events or emergencies, for instance, due to climate events or flooding that overload the MDC’s ability to meet regular demands,  that often limit a long-term vision on how the whole process could be better. It was essential to communicate a clear vision of the potential impact of the initiative and to demonstrate how each team or individual could benefit from its success. Building shared ownership took time and sustained engagement. \n\nAnother challenge is the large scale of the province, , with structural problems of poverty and infrastructure, as we mentioned above. AlsoThere is a context of public spending restrictions, lack of funding, and limited coordination between the federal and provincial governments—who belong to different political parties—which constrains the provincial government’s access to resources. The province has adopted a highly conservative spending strategy, which affects the availability of funds for this work plan. As a result, the UNDP project is currently almost entirely unfunded. \n\n The fragmentation and precarious infrastructure for receiving and processing requests also limits the ability to grasp the true scale of the demand the request center will need to address.

In many households that had water heaters but chose not to use them, installation issues, technical difficulties, and a lack of training and support were reported. Simple and low-complexity technical problems that had gone undetected were identified, including the improper installation of the device on the roof. This situation also applies to more costly but similarly low-complexity problems, such as construction deficiencies in the homes. The lack of follow-up and proper training has been a significant obstacle to the effective adoption of this technology. The absence of a critical mass of users further compounded the lack of support. As a result, non-users had no access to peer-provided information about shared experiences or potential solutions, nor did they have neighbors who could guide them through the learning curve of using the devices.\n\nDo you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment?

On the one hand, the technical barriers include the incorrect orientation of the device on rooftops, poor installation, and the incompatibility of housing infrastructure with the water heaters. On the other hand, the training barriers involve the lack of follow-up after installation, as there was no support to help users navigate the learning curve of integrating a new device with these characteristics into their daily lives.

Why?\nFirst, the results may be of interest to the country office. In particular, the environment &amp; sustainable development department can benefit from the findings of this experiment, as they promote the integration of environmental considerations into the development process, driving projects that contribute to sustainability and the fight against poverty. Additionally, they support the development of public policies at both general and territorial scales.  On the other hand, these results may also be relevant to the inclusive growth department, as it works with vulnerable populations, particularly those that could benefit from cost-saving initiatives.   \n\nSecond, these findings could be of interest to laboratories in other countries working on similar topics, as well as to RBLAC and other bureaus.\n\nWho outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "experiment_platform", "source_filename": "experiment_platform.csv", "title": "Sol en Casa (SEC) - Jujuy", "chunk_index": 6, "chunk_chars": 1825}}

They could use the results as a valuable tool, providing a model for public policies that seek to integrate sustainable energy solutions into social housing programs.\n\nDid this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?\nIn the initial phase of the research and development initiative, a first iteration was conducted through an exploratory study, which involved diagnosing the current situation of the households benefiting from the policy. Subsequently, efforts have been focused on securing funding for a new experiment, which could involve multiple iterations, although these have not yet been defined as they are still being designed.\n\nWhat advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?\nThis initiative for installing solar water heaters was carried out in 2016 and 2017. In this regard, conducting a situational diagnosis and user typology analysis prior to the experiment was crucial, as there was no initial information on the state of the households, especially given that the solar energy solutions had been installed some time ago. This type of diagnosis is necessary even for more recent initiatives, where it is not always clear whether people have adopted the solution.

In our case, although most of the households were public housing, there was socioeconomic diversity among users, which could lead to different lines of inquiry. Not all users necessarily had economic need as their primary motivation for using renewable energy.   \n\nFinally, this initial diagnosis has limitations, as the results cannot be extrapolated to the entire population. Therefore, more in-depth studies should be conducted to enhance confidence in the findings.\n\nCan this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?\nThis experiment can be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs. The methodology used (diagnostics, surveys, in-depth interviews, and focus groups) can be applied to other sustainable technology projects in sectors such as access to clean water, clean energy, health and well-being, or sustainable infrastructure. It is necessary to consider the infrastructure and local context in this experiment, since it depended on the high solar radiation in Jujuy, meaning that implementing a similar project in areas with lower sunlight levels would necessitate technological adjustments to ensure efficiency.  \n\nAdditionally, it needs to be considered the cultural adaptations to other local characteristics. Each community has its own unique barriers to adoption, levels of awareness, and communication networks. Some may require more extensive training and engagement strategies, while others may naturally share knowledge and experiences more effectively.

The purpose of the workshop was for the experts to gauge the local stakeholders' experiences related to the target behaviour (sustainable e-waste disposal), agree on the segmentation of the target population for further Behaviour Drivers analysis, and start assessing potential intervention opportunities collaboratively.  \n\nFollowing the workshop and guided by BISC, AccLab conducted multiple in-depth interviews with key population segments (youth, housewives, waste management workers, tech repair companies and individuals, and tech industry professionals) to capture a range of behaviours and motivations for the research. BISC then analysed the in-depth interviews using two methods: (1) Behavioural Influence Framework: analysing the underlying motivations and deterrents shaping the behaviour of Zugdidi residents towards e-waste; and (2) “Value Goals”: exploring the functional, emotional and social drivers that could encourage them to get involved in e-waste collection and proper disposal.  \n\nThe behaviour mapping process drew the contours of potential entry points for our experiment. To test the ground for our ideas, we held one final consultation (Ideation Workshop) with the local stakeholders. There, BISC presented the findings of the in-depth interviews and behaviour mapping and facilitated groupwork on possible interventions using BIT EAST framework. The result was crowdsourced intervention concepts selected based on impact and feasibility of implementation.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "experiment_platform", "source_filename": "experiment_platform.csv", "title": "Leveraging Community Action for Sustainable E-Waste Management in Zugdidi, Georgia", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1738}}

The study comprised of 3 experiments: (1) increasing visibility and convenience of e-waste collection infrastructure in a retail setting; (2) testing the role of messaging strategies in residential contexts (targeting vulnerable IDP communities); and (3) leveraging schools as hubs for social and educational influence, aiming to embed long-term, community-wide behavioural changes. In conjunction with the experiments, an observation phase was planned to document real-world e-waste disposal behaviours and motivations through qualitative observations, self-reported data, and quantitative disposal metrics in public settings, focusing on a local FabLab and library to capture diverse participant profiles. Together, these experiments were designed to address both the structural barriers (e.g., accessibility and infrastructure) and socio-psychological dynamics (e.g., norms, awareness, and messaging), bridging the intention-action gap – a common phenomenon where individuals’ stated intentions to engage in sustainable behaviours fail to translate into actions. The monitoring phase lasted 3 weeks at the end of which the quantitative and qualitative data were analysed to reveal the unique challenges and opportunities in e-waste collection in Zugdidi.\n\nIf you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)\nCivil Society\nAcademia\nPrivate Sector\nGovernment (&amp; related)\nUnited Nations\n\nWhat is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?\nBetween 10,000- and 20,000 USD\n\nPlease upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.\nResults\nOnly complete this section when presenting results\nWas the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

While each experiment and observation phase revealed unique challenges and opportunities, the overarching findings underscore the importance of integrating behavioural, structural, and educational strategies for fostering sustainable waste management practices. By addressing logistical barriers, extending interventions, and leveraging community engagement, future initiatives can build on these insights to achieve broader and more sustained participation in e-waste disposal. These lessons hold relevance not only for Zugdidi but also for other communities seeking to improve e-waste management systems.\n\nWhat are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?\nWe learned that understanding the user’s needs through listening and building trust are essential for fostering the empathy required to gain user traction. The community consultations (including key stakeholder surveys, three workshops in Zugdidi, and in-depth interviews) helped us gauge Zugdidi residents’ perceptions and behaviours regarding e-waste collection and disposal. However, even more importantly, practicing active listening allowed us to genuinely empathise with our target audience’s perspective, build local social capital, earn the trust of our partners, and engage all stakeholders with greater intention, enthusiasm, and a shared sense of purpose. The true rewards of listening and building social capital in Zugdidi became evident when local partners took the initiative and proposed ideas for the project’s future. We realised that, regardless of the project timeline, such interventions should focus on continued engagement with community ecosystems for ownership and sustainability.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "experiment_platform", "source_filename": "experiment_platform.csv", "title": "Leveraging Community Action for Sustainable E-Waste Management in Zugdidi, Georgia", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_chars": 1838}}

Initially, we hypothesized that most e-waste would be collected at schools because (1) a large concentration of youth are present in schools, (2) community consultations indicated that students are particularly receptive to new ideas and behavioural changes, and (3) we had held an informational session on e-waste at one of the schools. The experiment, however, revealed that most e-waste was collected at the city library, whose director turned out to be a community leader, spreading the word not only among the library’s youth and adult visitors but also within his network of co-workers, friends, and family. While our initial assumptions were not entirely disproven - schools did, in fact, collect a significant amount of e-waste - we learned not to underestimate the power of civic leaders and the influence they have in mobilizing broader community support and participation.\n\nConsidering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after?

To address this, we had to plan with flexibility in mind—ensuring that community consultations were completed before the elections to avoid overlapping with critical phases. We also accelerated key milestones, completing the segmentation, in-depth interviews, and behaviour mapping processes within just a few weeks. Last but not least, leveraging the combination of CO institutional memory in innovation and novel knowledge brought by AccLab's new members played a pivotal role in navigating the uncertainties involved.\n\n(2) We also discovered that some partners were more challenging to bring on board than others, requiring us to rely heavily on creative problem-solving to uncover hidden opportunities and find more “unusual suspects”!  \n\n(3) Despite leadership support, we encountered the need to balance research needs against timeline and budgetary constraints, which were further exacerbated by lengthy operational processes for procurement of technical services.

Gender-based disparities are evident, with a notable percentage of women not using computers, while men exhibit a more varied distribution in computer usage. In mobile phone skills, women tend to have higher confidence, but both genders exhibit significant gaps in software and internet-related challenges. The gender divide is also felt in the attendance and participation in the training. Many young girls between 19 to 25 years old have month old babies that they need to bring to the class, while others are forced to skip training sometimes due to childcare duties. While the pilot does not include dedicated childcare support, in future iterations this is critical to ensure equal access to training. \n\nInternet access is another important point.

This suggests a positive attitude towards technology and an openness to learning and integrating digital tools into their lives. Participants are also very confident in their capacities and expressing a desire to continue using the skills they acquired after training, especially in ​​social media for business and graphic content creation. This indicates that practical and applicable skills are more likely to be retained and used in the future. Applications like Canva, used to create visual and graphic content, show limited use, but there is interest in learning and improving these skills. This indicates a possible demand for training in graphic design and visual content creation, valuable skills in digital marketing and communication.\n\nThe most common use of technology is to take pictures most participants mentioned that they use the phone camera to take pictures every day or at least twice a week. There is a clear trend of frequent use of popular applications such as WhatsApp and Facebook, indicating that participants are familiar and comfortable with communication platforms and social networks. This may reflect the importance of social communication and networking in their daily lives. However, the main reason behind the use of Facebook is that it is currently free to use in the country.

However, while the free Wi-Fi did not lead to a statistically significant increase in the number of visitors to Balboa Park (compared to the control condition constructed synthetically), the results revealed that visitors who were already at the park perceived the Wi-Fi as an added value, improving their experience. This supports the idea that free connectivity enhances public space, but not in the way initially expected.\n\nWhat are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?\nThe experiment revealed that free Wi-Fi in Balboa Park didn’t significantly increase visitor numbers, but enhanced the experience for those already present, improving perceptions by 18.8 points. Visitors informed about Wi-Fi stayed longer and were more likely to recommend the park, indicating high potential for customer satisfaction and loyalty, though spending didn't increase.\n\nIt was also recommended to ISTU to focus on digital literacy for small business owners to leverage free connectivity.

Why is it important to do this experiment?\nThe experimental activity design focused on understanding how farmers respond to climate adaptation messages. We conducted surveys with randomly assigned items, delivered through CAPI (Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing) to local farmers. By dividing participants into treatment and control groups, we tested if peer actions influence farmers’ willingness to adopt adaptive practices. Additionally, framing experiments examined how different contexts impact attitudes toward adaptation, and traditional knowledge tests assessed whether integrating indigenous practices with forecasts can build trust in official weather data.\n\nWhat is your hypothesis?

This random assignment helps us understand how varying pieces of information or framing can influence responses, as it controls for potential biases. The surveys were delivered directly to farmers in person using CAPI (Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing), a data collection method where enumerators use electronic devices, like tablets, to input responses in real time.

We hypothesized that if climate adaptation practices were framed as already adopted by local peers, farmers would show a higher motivation to implement these practices themselves. The results confirmed this: 87.5% of the treatment group—those informed about peer adoption—expressed motivation to adopt similar measures, compared to 76.7% in the control group.\n\nAdditionally, framing adaptation benefits versus risks differently influenced farmer perception. When information was framed negatively (risks of not adapting), it had a stronger impact, with 75% of farmers seeing climate change impacts as likely compared to 41% when presented positively. These findings highlight the influence of peer examples and loss aversion in climate adaptation motivation.\n\nWhat are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?\nPeer Influence Enhances Motivation: Farmers were more motivated to adopt climate adaptation practices when they perceived them as popular among their peers. This shows that a social proof approach can drive higher adoption rates in climate adaptation.\n\nFraming Matters: Presenting information with a negative framing (emphasizing risks of inaction) proved more effective in making farmers feel the urgency of adapting to climate change than positive framing (emphasizing benefits of action). This highlights that loss aversion is a strong motivator in this context.\n\nTrust in Traditional Knowledge: Farmers showed high confidence in traditional climate knowledge, and the combination of traditional insights with meteorological data seemed to foster even more trust.

Current design of mounting on lids of trash cans does not effectively address the challenge since the small and portable trash cans are regularly emptied onto large skip bins. So, the refined Smart Trashcan should support skip bins. Secondly, mounting a solar panel on top of an easily accessible trash can lid makes it vulnerable to petty thieves. A proposed refinement is to redesign the smart trash can device for mounting on streetlight stands and have skip bins placed directly under the streetlights. \n\n2. Prototype materials such as wooden casing are not robust enough to withstand harsh weather and outdoor environments especially during the rainy season.  The recommendation is to use the casing of the streetlight poles to protect the gadgets from harsh weather.\n\n3.

What would you change?\n\nThere are some logistical challenges that need to be overcome when there is such a large number of workshops and participants, each of them running for a short time. On the one hand, the goals of the workshop need to be limited and simple instructions. Then, there is a need to have multiple facilitators, and to complement the general facilitation with facilitation in each table with participants. It's important to constantly remind participants to write their ideas, as there is a tendency to only share them by speaking, and writen ideas are needed for analysis. Finally sensemaking of such a large amount of post-its required non trivial decisions on how to group and categorize the ideas. The final categories can be dependent on the level of abstraction and background of the person analyzing so they need to be revalidated with participants and other facilitators, eventually after a few iterations, key ideas do seem to converge.\n\nFrom design to results, how long did this activity take?

On the other hand, it weakens institutions, creating mistrust from society, stagnation, lack of agreements, and ultimately reduces quality and coverage of services. \n\nAlso, we learned that from the perspective of public officials, some actions to mitigate the effects of polarization include managing information both within and outside the institution, strengthening coordination between institutions, supporting the well-being of public servants, and promoting social participation.\n\nWhat were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?\n\nSee the sections on observation to methodology.", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "experiment_platform", "source_filename": "experiment_platform.csv", "title": "Identifying effects of polarization on public officials", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1987}}

To do this the facilitator needs skills to keep track of the research objectives, manage time of the interventions, and quick synthesis of the contents to ensure the conversation stays relevant while participants feel comfortable.

However, some are more appropriate in scenarios of high polarization, while others in scenarios of low polarization. In scenarios of low polarization, it's useful to not treat dialogue with all the formalities as this will miss opportunities. In those opportunity cases, it's valuable to increase the number and diversity of participants. Also, it's useful to incorporate digital technologies and disruptive exercises to increase the diversity of ideas and move more quickly to action. On the other hand, in challenging scenarios it's important to be prudent regarding sensitivities. It's important to prepare conditions for dialogue, take into account symbolysis associated with respect, maintain congruence between speech and action, enforced the mutually agreed rules, reduce barriers for honesty and manage difficult emotions.\n\nWhat were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?\n\nTime constraints were an initial challenge. Also, it is challenging to gather a group of diverse experts in a context of high polarization, so to increase chances of success actors with previous relations. Also, it was difficult for participants to stay on topic, they often wanted to give long speeches, or only observe. Moreover, the list of alternatives considered for the scenarios were all consider valuable, so it was difficult to prioritize among them, so multiple prompts were needed.\n\nWho at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity?

Identifying a diverse group of experts with the willingness to engage in the workshop is not trivial. The strategy used was to take advantage of previous personal relations with dialogue leaders in different fielsd with whom trust was already stablished. And ensure the implementation of the workshop was conducted in a respectful way, with clear and anticipated results that were valued to all participants.

If any\nIt corresponds to our Artificial Intelligence and Democracy portfolio.\n\nWhat is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?\nThis activity addresses an increasingly prevalent challenge in the current context: political polarization, a multi-causal phenomenon whose deepening is a global trend. One of these causes is the use of algorithms aimed at promoting user interaction and participation on social networks. Algorithms tend to display content that aligns with users' beliefs, intensifying their negative feelings to encourage consumption. \n\nFurthermore, specifically in Argentine society, the sociopolitical context favors polarization between supporters of different political parties. In the context of the 40th anniversary of Argentine democracy, we use artificial intelligence tools, specifically natural language processing (NLP) through Chat GPT, to promote consensus and social cohesion. We emphasize what unites Argentine society beyond its political differences. To achieve this, we analyzed presidential inauguration and legislative session opening speeches from the last 40 years. We carry out an exercise that consists of three parts: discourse analysis, exploration of the topics addressed, and generation of a unified discourse from the corpus of analyzed texts.

ChatGPT can only operate with 4000 characters at a time, input (the question) and output (the answer) combined. Since most speeches exceed this number, they were divided into fragments of 2250 characters for analysis. Each of these fragments is then sent to ChatGPT with a prompt asking if that fragment addresses a particular topic (along with the definition of the topic) and, if so, ChatGPT is asked to copy exactly the specific part in which it appears. This action is repeated for each chunk and each of the topics. In this way, we obtain the topics addressed in all the fragments of each speech. From the identified themes in each speech, we examined the frequency of each theme per president over time, along with their associations with other themes and the specific words used in addressing them, among other aspects.\n\nWhat is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?\nThe unit of analysis is presidential speeches.

What would you change?\nRegarding the methodology chosen to conduct the action, which involves analyzing speeches from various presidents over the last 40 years, it is crucial to address potential biases arising from the frequency with which different presidents spoke. For this reason, we opted to standardize the sample by selecting inauguration speeches and opening sessions of legislative sessions, as these must be delivered by all presidents. \n\nIt is also important to consider biases inherent to the AI itself, particularly regarding text generation, as ChatGPT tends to converge to commonplaces and faces the potential presence of biases in the results due to the nature of the data it is trained on.\n\nFrom design to results, how long did this activity take?

What were your main learnings during this experiment?\nThe main learning during this experiment is related to creation of the unified speech. The creation of the unified speech is more than the union of fragments from different texts. It requires identifying common themes, conjugating them, and creating a voice that maintains the style of the presidents. AI tools like ChatGPT add great value to this task, as they not only enable quantitative discourse analysis but can generate text within a context.\n\nWho at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity?

Using a Fresnel lens, solar energy is concentrated to generate the high temperatures needed to melt recycled HDPE, eliminating the need for electricity and reducing carbon emissions. This carbon-neutral process makes plastic recycling more accessible and sustainable, especially in small communities or remote areas with limited infrastructure. To support the process, a simple, flat-pack injection mold device has been designed using commonly available materials, allowing easy assembly without the need for specialized tools. While the system successfully transforms plastic waste into durable new products, it does present challenges in maintaining consistent and specific heat levels required for precise molding.\nnull\nsdgs: Responsible consumption and production\n\nthematic_areas: Concentrated Solar Power\nthematic_areas: re-use\nthematic_areas: recycle waste plastic\n\nconsent: https://acclabplatforms.blob.core.windows.net/consent/uploads/f9547c14-bb5f-40e3-af83-5644a11c46e6/de8ae5f930b70852eaa158081c6def68.pdf", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "solution_platform", "source_filename": "solution_platform.csv", "title": "Concentrated Solar Forming", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1228}}

The actors involved come from low-income segments, especially from rural and peri-urban areas of Paraguay, where MSMEs face significant barriers to formalization and growth. Gender perspective: Although gender inequalities were not directly addressed in the program design, situations emerged that prompted reflection on women’s labor overload due to the double workday, and on power dynamics influenced by male partners, such as jealousy or lack of trust. The program promotes an inclusive approach, encouraging the active participation of women in leadership, development, and decision-making within the garment workshops. It also aims to advance the labor rights of women and girls, ensuring a fairer and more equitable work environment. Lessons Learned Linking MSMEs to anchor companies can create a more predictable environment for small businesses, but it requires that large companies have strong internal capacities and access to external support services. Market volatility and instability at national and regional levels make it difficult for MSMEs to invest confidently, suggesting that public procurement could offer stable demand and promote formalization. Training in conflict management and communication improves authority dynamics within workshops, contributing to a more efficient and pleasant work environment. However, the lack of skilled labor in the industry remains a major barrier. There is strong interest in collaboration and business associations to improve productivity and working conditions, but MSMEs need more support in developing administrative and policy capacities.\nnull\nsdgs: Gender equality\nsdgs: Decent work and economic growth\n\nconsent: https://www.undp.org/es/paraguay/proyectos/local\n\nthematic_areas: asociatividad", "output": "", "metadata": {"source_type": "solution_platform", "source_filename": "solution_platform.csv", "title": "Local: Continuous Improvement Plans for MSMEs", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1984}}

A citizen laboratory that promotes participatory, open, and experimental innovation to strengthen local democracy, activate community capacities, and build a more just and inclusive territory. Who promotes it? Promoted by the Municipal Government of Natalio, with facilitation from the UNDP Paraguay Accelerator Lab. What does it involve? The lab is a platform for experimentation and learning that combines participatory methodologies (such as citizen mapping, empathy interviews, open calls, etc.) with innovation approaches. Its goal is to explore community solutions to development challenges. What does it achieve? Builds a culture of participation and community engagement Creates space for intergenerational learning Supports citizen-centered innovation to solve public challenges Promotes environmental awareness and circular economy practices at the local level Development stage: Consolidated Origin and Actors Origin The Citizen Lab was launched as a pilot of the UNDP Accelerator Lab. Actors Involved Youth Network of Natalio: Young participants co-designed and facilitated lab activities Municipality of Natalio: Hosted and supported the initiative UNDP Paraguay: Technical support and methodology design through the Accelerator Lab Leave No One Behind Socioeconomic Base The territory includes small agricultural producers, youth, and women’s committees. The lab explicitly aimed to reach underrepresented groups, especially youth and low-income rural families. Gender Perspective Yes – women participated both in design and implementation. The Youth Network is composed of over 60% young women. Lessons Learned General Innovation requires adaptation: Participatory innovation processes must be tailored to the local culture and capacities. Community leadership is key: Youth-led facilitation increases legitimacy and ownership.
