What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\nPanama’s municipal markets are critical public infrastructures that serve as economic, social, and cultural hubs—but they are also major contributors to the city’s organic waste crisis. The Red Integral de Mercados Municipales Urbanos (RIMMU) is the third-largest source of organic waste in Panama City, where over 2,500 tons of waste are generated daily—50% of which is organic.

This collaboration seeks to transform waste management in five public markets using circular economy principles, while also promoting inclusive governance, innovation, and behavior change.\nThe initiative strategically integrates a portfolio of experiments across different intervention areas to collectively test what works in building a sustainable model. These experiments include: testing composting models, piloting food rescue programs, activating placemaking for behavior change, co-developing a digital dashboard system for waste management, and launching communication campaigns for environmental awareness. Each experiment is designed to feed learning and adaptation into the others, allowing for real-time iteration and systemic integration.\nThe initiative is grounded in multi-actor coordination involving local government (Dirección de Mercados Municipales), civil society (Fundación Rescate de Alimentos), academia (Smithsonian Institute), and the private sector (Bliss). It aims to reduce organic waste sent to landfills, improve food security, generate compost, and activate markets as sustainable public spaces. However, the current situation still shows disjointed efforts, weak policy incentives, data silos, and limited community ownership—leading to missed opportunities for economic value recovery, worsening climate impacts, and continued citizen disengagement from public market governance.\n\n2,500 tons of waste are generated daily in Panama; 50% is organic.\n\nThe RIMMU is the third-largest source of mostly organic waste.\n\n5.6% of Panama’s population (approx. 200,000 people) face food insecurity.\n\n71.1% of adults suffer from diet-related diseases.\n\nTarget: Reduce landfill waste by 10%, and produce 150 kg of compost monthly.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:** \nTransform waste management in five public markets using circular economy principles, promoting inclusive governance, innovation, and behavior change to reduce landfill waste by 10% and produce 150 kg of compost monthly.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n1.

In this new Action Plan, we focus on a deeper understanding of the feasibility procedure and on piloting a concrete solution.  \n\nThe framing of our current challenge emerged from our previous efforts with the Water Commission to enhance the process for evaluating new water service connections in Querétaro. While the current feasibility analysis provides valuable information, several areas of opportunity for improving the analysis have been identified. Estimating water availability and future demand remains complex due to fragmented and outdated data, limited analytical tools, and coordination challenges across departments and institutions. Additionally, the ability to anticipate and respond to climate variability is constrained by the absence of integrated scenario planning tools. Internally, information silos and the lack of standardized mechanisms for data sharing can delay decision-making. These conditions contribute to a reactive planning environment, instead of a more strategic future-oriented one.\n\nWater scarcity is a big issue in Mexico, including the state of Queretaro.

These numbers show the vulnerability of the state with regards to access to water, illustrating the urgency of tackling this challenge. [1]\n\nAccording to the Water Information System Monitoring of Mexico’s Major Dams, as of July 2024, Queretaro has 7 damns, 4 of them have reservoir levels of less than 10%, 2 damns have between 11 and 15% and only 1 has a reservoir level of 90%. [2]\n\nWater scarcity in Queretaro has been exacerbated by population growth and an increase in housing. Queretaro stands out due to its economic and industrial development, ranking 5th place on a national level in terms of competitiveness [3]. Due to the competitive job market in the state, in the past years, many people have settled in Queretaro.\n\nComparing the Population and Housing Census of 2010 with that of 2020, the number of households increased by 63.45%, and the population by 47.9%. The number of households increased to a greater extent. One house was built for every 2.37 inhabitants, as shown in the image with the visualization of statistics. [4]\n\nAccording to the 2022 National Survey of Household Income and Expenditures (ENIGH), 68.22% of the population in Queretaro has access to piped water and sanitation, and 68.46% have access to safely sourced drinking water and sanitation services.\n\nIn this context of water scarcity, population growth and urban development, it is important to address the issue of granting feasibilities for new connections to the hydraulic network in a more sustainable way and based on long-term planning.\n\nSources: \n\n[1]https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/tools/DATA/Climatolog%C3%ADa/Sequ%C3%ADa/Monitor%20de%20sequ%C3%ADa%20en%20M%C3%A9xico/Seguimiento%20de%20Sequ%C3%ADa/MSM20240630.pdf\n\n[2] https://sinav30.conagua.gob.mx:8080/Presas/", "output": "Here is the summary of the action plan:\n\n**Action Goal:** Implement a sustainable and long-term approach to granting feasibilities for new connections to the hydraulic network in Queretaro, addressing water scarcity, population growth, and urban development.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Back in May 2024, it was reported that  El Centenario, La Llave, and La Venta dams were completely empty [1].\n\nTwo of the other four dams in the region barely exceeded this, as they were holding less than 5% of their total capacity.\n\nThis signal illustrates the urgency of contributing to the management of water resources in the state.\n\nThe privatization of water:\n\nThere are 23 concessions granted by the State Water Commission of Queretaro to private companies, including real estate firms for urban housing and commercial developments. Among the main concessionaires are Operadora Querétaro Moderno and Fraccionamientos Selectos I. This situation leads to discontent among the population, many of them complain about excessive prices in the water service [2] [3].\n\nThis highlights the dynamics of water in the state between private and public sectors, inviting us to think how the feasibilities process could contribute to a better planning of water resources in the future, and better decision making when it comes to deciding if the provision of water should be a private or public enterprise.\n\nThe impact of water scarcity in productive activities:", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nImplement a sustainable management of water resources and explore the use of generative AI in the public sector to improve decision-making for water planning.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Aquaculture producers blame low water levels for limiting fish farming. Aquaculturists in the region point out that several of their colleagues have migrated to the United States due to the income drop caused by these conditions.\n\nAdditionally, agricultural and livestock producers have also experienced reduced production due to low reservoir levels. Even if it rains, there is inadequate infrastructure for water capturing. [4] [5]\n\nThis situation showcases how various sectors are being affected by the water crisis and invites us to think how the feasibility procedure for new water connections for housing and commercial use could be managed in a more sustainable way in order to ensure access to water in the future not only for new constructions, but also for productive activities.\n\nAnother signal that illustrates this situation is related to the fact that Queretaro has become a hub for investment with the arrival of several data centers. However, it is anticipated that in the long term, energy demands may not be met. This is exacerbated by bureaucratic procedures, as companies often lack information about how the energy they use is generated.

And while the examples are relatively new and scarce, this technology has the potential to enhance —and even transform— the way governments operate. As shown in the image, some of the trends of using generative AI include improve speed and efficiency of public services and engagement, optimize employee time by reducing manual processes, draw insights to empower decision-makers, etc. [8].\n\nOn the other hand, the huge impact that AI systems can have in various domains of our lives call for a critical, thoughtful, imaginative and cautious approach to designing AI strategies.\n\nAs Vaugh Tan frames it: “To have good AI strategy, we need to make reasoned decisions about:\n\n1.     What humans can do which AI systems cannot — these are tasks which should be done by humans.\n\n2.     What AI systems can do much better than humans — these are tasks which AI systems should be built to do.” [9]\n\nThis becomes particularly urgent in the context of public services because these systems need to ensure human-rights, inclusion, ethics, transparency.

Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?\nThe Accelerator Lab adds unique value by operating in a practice-oriented, experimental mode—designing and testing proof-of-concept solutions in real-world conditions. Building on prior systemic analysis, the Lab will apply agile methodologies to prototype a AI tool and generate rapid learnings to inform future iterations. This approach enables low-risk exploration of innovative pathways and supports public institutions in making more informed, data-driven decisions.\n\n At the same time, the Lab’s convening power and participatory methods foster collaboration across institutional and sectoral boundaries. In a context where UNDP Mexico is still building its profile in AI and digitalization, this work positions the Country Office as a credible partner for inclusive and sustainable tech adoption. The Lab’s connection to a global learning network further amplifies its impact, allowing it to share insights and draw from international experiences.\n\nShort “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?", "output": "Here is the summarized action plan:\n\n**Action Goal:** Implementing a Generative AI tool for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning in Queretaro, Mexico.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n* Conduct systemic analysis (Weeks 1-4)\n* Design and test proof-of-concept solutions using agile methodologies (Weeks 5-12)\n* Prototype AI tool and generate rapid learnings (Weeks 13-16)\n* Inform future iterations and share insights with international learning network\n\n**Resources Needed / Actors:**\n\n* UNDP Mexico Country Office\n* Local government agencies (e.g. Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources)\n* Indigenous communities and activists\n* Microsoft AI experts\n* Accelerator Lab team members\n\n**Outcomes Achieved (if noted):**\n\n* Development of a functional Generative AI tool for water planning\n* Improved collaboration between institutional and sectoral boundaries\n* Enhanced credibility for UNDP Mexico in AI and digitalization\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n* Importance of participatory methods in fostering collaboration across boundaries\n* Value of agile methodologies in rapid prototyping and testing\n* Need for ongoing learning and adaptation to ensure successful implementation\n\n**Follow-up Actions / Monitoring Suggestions:**\n\n* Regular progress updates with local government agencies and indigenous communities\n* Ongoing evaluation of AI tool's effectiveness and impact on water planning\n* Continued collaboration with international learning network to share insights and best practices", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Learning by Testing: Generative AI for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning", "chunk_index": 7, "chunk_chars": 1908, "generated_by": "llama3.2", "generated_at": "2025-09-03T16:24:35.883073Z", "gen_config": {"max_new_tokens": 512, "temperature": 0.0, "stream": false}}}

(Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) \nWe worked with government and the Barbados Museum &amp; Historical Society on hosting the A.I. Symposium on Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage. Based on this event which included 6 panels of subject matter experts, we gathered the following insights:\n\n1) The Double-Edged Sword of A.I.\n\nSeveral panelists noted the many benefits that A.I. can bring to the Orange Economy in the Caribbean, including democratizing access to cultural heritage, enhancing arts education capacities and opening new markets for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Many of these positive shifts are already being seen, even if on a small scale. On the flipside, numerous risks were noted - with the potential for A.I. to exacerbate inequalities, further entrench biases, and threaten cultural diversity. From a security standpoint, ethical concerns around data use, privacy, and intellectual property were frequently raised. This resulted in a double-edged sword dynamic requiring proper stewardship to ensure the safe usage of A.I. for creative purposes. \n\n2) Ethics, Equity and Human Rights", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan:\n\n**Action Goal:** Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy: Closure\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n* Hosted an AI Symposium on Caribbean Arts & Heritage with government and Barbados Museum & Historical Society\n* Gathered insights from 6 panels of subject matter experts\n\n**Resources Needed / Actors:**\n\n* Government\n* Barbados Museum & Historical Society\n* Subject matter experts (6)\n\n**Outcomes Achieved (if noted):**\n\n* Gained valuable insights on the benefits and risks of AI in the Orange Economy\n* Identified potential double-edged sword dynamic requiring proper stewardship\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n1.

This included calls for a transparent, fair and rights-based approach to A.I. regulation. Additionally, given that A.I. tools are often consumed rather than produced in the Caribbean, it was recognized that A.I. must be anchored in local values rather than those imported externally from global tech hubs. This reflects the reality that dominant A.I. systems typically include Western biases and exclude Caribbean perspectives. As such, there is a need to train A.I. on regional data while also making efforts to protect that data from misuse.\n\n3) Governance Gaps and the Demand for Regional Strategy\n\nIn Barbados and among the wider Caribbean, A.I. policies are under development, especially when it comes to the creative industries where issues such as deepfakes, voice cloning and unauthorized use of likenesses are prevalent. In this process, there is the distinct challenge of keeping up with the fast speed of A.I. technologies, which are constantly evolving. To address this nascent governance field, regional collaboration was recommended with emphasis on solutions co-designed with grassroots communities, artists, technologists and policymakers alongside institutions such as UNDP, BMHS and ICOM as key partners. This Caribbean-wide approach could together address A.I. policy, digital infrastructure and cultural preservation.\n\n4) A.I. and the Orange Economy", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nExplore Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy with a focus on ethical framework, local values, and regional data protection.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Several artists underscored the importance of understanding digital ownership, authorship and authentication in the age of A.I., resulting in a strong demand for digital rights and policies that prioritize creators. Additionally, fair compensation for creatives was mentioned and tied to the devaluation of art forms that could occur through A.I., as well as the risks of job displacement posed by emerging tools in graphic design, sound production and editing.\n\n5) Education and Digital Capacity Building  \n\nThe Government of Barbados is integrating digital capacity-building efforts into the classroom, seen in coding, digital literacy and civics in the curriculum. These efforts are ultimately preparing students for a future deeply impacted by A.I. At the same time, arts education is focusing on critical thinking, responsible technology use and empowering youth to be active creators rather than passive consumers. This also connects to instilling a sense of integrity and ownership among art producers in the A.I. landscape.\n\n6) A.I. and Heritage Preservation\n\nGlobally in the heritage field, A.I. is being used to digitize heritage-based archives, enhance metadata creation and support conservation. The digitization of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), which includes language, rituals, crafts and oral traditions, is a bit more complex, however, as these elements are harder to digitize and protect. Panelists found that A.I. can help document ICH, but that the fundamentals of trust, consent and cultural sensitivity must be established first. To best future-proof these efforts, the significance of open-source tools, distributed storage and non-proprietary formats for sustainability purposes were voiced.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:** Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy: Closure\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n* Integrate digital capacity-building efforts into the classroom, focusing on coding, digital literacy, and civics\n* Enhance arts education to emphasize critical thinking, responsible technology use, and empowering youth as active creators\n* Explore A.I. applications for heritage preservation, including digitization of archives and conservation\n\n**Resources Needed / Actors:**\n\n* Government of Barbados\n* Educational institutions\n* Arts organizations\n* Heritage preservation experts\n* Open-source tool developers\n\n**Outcomes Achieved (if noted):**\n\n* Development of digital capacity-building programs in schools\n* Establishment of arts education curricula emphasizing responsible technology use and creator empowerment\n* Successful implementation of A.I. applications for heritage preservation, including digitization and conservation efforts\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n* The importance of establishing trust, consent, and cultural sensitivity when using A.I. for heritage preservation\n* The need for open-source tools, distributed storage, and non-proprietary formats for sustainable sustainability purposes\n* The potential risks of job displacement posed by emerging A.I. tools in creative industries\n\n**Follow-up Actions / Monitoring Suggestions:**\n\n* Regularly assess the effectiveness of digital capacity-building programs and arts education curricula\n* Monitor the implementation of A.I. applications for heritage preservation and provide feedback to experts and stakeholders\n* Continuously evaluate the impact of A.I. on the Orange Economy, including its effects on intellectual property, authorship, and fair compensation for creatives", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy: Closure", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 1974, "generated_by": "llama3.2", "generated_at": "2025-09-03T16:28:12.248350Z", "gen_config": {"max_new_tokens": 512, "temperature": 0.0, "stream": false}}}

Concerns around automated harassment, surveillance, and data exploitation were raised. To mitigate these potential pitfalls, panelists recommended intersectionality, community-led safeguards and inclusive data practices in A.I. \n\n8) A.I. in Archaeology &amp; Heritage Preservation\n\nIn archaeology, history is meeting modern technology through applications of A.I. to geophysical surveys, predictive modeling and 3D reconstructions of archaeological sites. This presents valuable inroads to repatriation, education, and cultural storytelling. Still, worries about data ownership, community consent and digital colonialism were expressed as worthy of greater attention and investigation.\n\n9) Call to Action: Local Innovation &amp; Collaboration  \n\nResoundingly heard throughout the panels was a call for the Caribbean to get involved in developing its own A.I. tools while training local talent and shaping global technology narratives. To do so, a push was made for collaboration across sectors, merging government, academia, civil society and creatives together. Overall, A.I. was deemed a transformative opportunity if approached with care, equity, and strategic vision.\n\nConsidering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process?

Due to the lack of overarching government services architecture and no clear definition of who will develop core and common services that can be (re)used by all other systems, it appears that many different government organizations are procuring and implementing very similar systems, often developing software components that have already been developed elsewhere. This is likely highly economically inefficient. More importantly, the lack of interoperability standards, data standards, and other technical standards means these systems will not easily share data or communicate with each other. As a result, a ‘government-wide’ service orientation is missed, compounding the economic inefficiencies.  \n\nIn 2024 UNDP worked with NCIT and President’s office to conduct a comprehensive situation analysis of digital transformation in Maldives.

This degradation threatens rural livelihoods, biodiversity, and national climate goals, particularly since livestock emissions comprise a major part of Mongolia’s GHG reduction commitments. Despite interest in green finance, the lack of credible, standardized data on rangeland health and carbon impacts hampers progress. Current data systems are centralized, slow, and costly, with limited integration of local knowledge. The challenge involves multiple stakeholders—herders, policymakers, and financial institutions—and produces undesired effects such as weak climate finance readiness, poor land management decisions, and limited access to voluntary carbon markets.

In turn, public goods such as these services can reduce vulnerabilities and turn back the dial on inequalities, a key factor of democratic backsliding as shown by the 2023/2024 Human Development Report “Breaking the gridlock” and the 2024 UNDP Trends Report “The Landscape of Development”. As inequality rises, the strength of democracy falls, leading to a pressing social scenario where most of the half of the world population are supporting leaders that erode democracy. Public innovation, therefore, is an enabler in the path toward stopping democratic backsliding.\n\nAt the same time, the public sector is facing new challenges with the arrival of frontier technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), both in its internal and external relations and outcomes. The opportunities and risks that come with AI make the need to innovate even more relevant: to seize the potential of AI for good while mitigating its dangers, public innovation needs to emerge in the institutional, social, and technological dimensions of our public services and policies, to improve the quality of their outcomes and to respond to the contemporary problems of the citizens, including the need for a better and more direct relation and participation.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nIncrease the capacity of innovation in the public sector to deliver better public services and policies that improve citizens' wellbeing and reduce inequalities.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Another key ally is the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), who has committed significant financial resources to carry out the capacity building programs that will strengthen scientific capacity, as well as directly supporting different forms of innovation. By asking how we can develop capacities for innovation in the public sector, we engaged with these allies in a continuous learning journey which is now entering its fifth year. In each new learning cycle, new lessons emerged about how to build capacities for research, development and innovation in the public sector, and its key supporting organizations. We first helped ENI identify the key national innovation challenges that today orient public policies such as the Science, Technology, and Innovation Agenda of CONACYT (https://www.conacyt.gov.py/documentos-agenda-nacional-ciencia-tecnologia-innovacion). As the pandemic ensued, our learning turn to how we can articulate the national innovation system toward one of those challenges, which was already aligned to the challenge increasing resilience against pandemics (https://www.conacyt.gov.py/presentaron-plataforma-innovadora-para-fortalecer-iniciativas-emprendedores). Articulation opened the opportunity to apply our R&amp;D+i methods to specific challenges within this bigger one in 2021, through Wendá (https://wenda.org.py/).\n\nAs a result of this alliance, the Public Innovators Program was born in 2022. The Program builds capacities in public officials from several national institutions through hands-on training, mentoring, and the development of innovation pilots. During its first three editions, the Program trained over 150 public officials and supported the implementation and evaluation of 16 public innovation pilots.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nDevelop capacities for social and public innovation in Paraguay's public sector to address national innovation challenges and increase resilience against pandemics.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1. 2019-2020: Engage with ENI and CONACYT to identify key national innovation challenges.\n2. 2020-2021: Articulate the national innovation system toward increasing resilience against pandemics.\n3. 2021: Apply R&D+i methods to specific challenges within the bigger challenge through Wendá.\n4. 2022: Launch the Public Innovators Program, a capacity-building initiative for public officials from several national institutions.\n5. 2022-2024 (first three editions): Train over 150 public officials and support the implementation and evaluation of 16 public innovation pilots.\n\n**Resources Needed / Actors:**\n\n*   ENI (National Innovation Strategy)\n*   CONACYT (National Council of Science and Technology)\n*   Wendá\n*   Public Innovators Program participants and mentors\n\n**Outcomes Achieved (if noted):**\n\n*   Trained over 150 public officials through the Public Innovators Program.\n*   Supported the implementation and evaluation of 16 public innovation pilots.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n*   The importance of continuous learning and adaptation in building capacities for research, development, and innovation in the public sector.\n*   The value of partnerships with key allies like ENI and CONACYT in addressing national innovation challenges.\n\n**Follow-up Actions / Monitoring Suggestions:**\n\n*   Continuously evaluate the impact of the Public Innovators Program on the implementation of public innovation pilots.\n*   Monitor the progress of the national innovation system toward increasing resilience against pandemics.\n*   Review and update the capacity-building strategies to address emerging challenges and opportunities in the field of social and public innovation.", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "2025_Capacities for Social and Public Innovation", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_chars": 1997, "generated_by": "llama3.2", "generated_at": "2025-09-03T16:35:57.881527Z", "gen_config": {"max_new_tokens": 512, "temperature": 0.0, "stream": false}}}

Located at the confluence of the Cuanza and Lucala rivers, it has potential for cultural and ecological tourism, connecting with pre-colonial heritage and the slave trade. The site includes historic monuments, and there are efforts to preserve and enhance the heritage, with the potential to make it a key tourist destination. Historical evidence reveals a direct connection between early African-American families and records of enslaved individuals who trace their origins to Angola. Massangano was an important departure point for those who were taken to the Americas. In 1619, the first Africans from Angola arrived on the shores of Hampton Roads. It is estimated that over 12 million Americans in the United States are of Angolan descent. The Tucker family is descended from the first Africans enslaved in North America. The William Tucker 1624 Society intends to continue collaborating with the Government of Angola in various areas. Promoting tourism with a focus on Afro-descendant culture in Angola can be a gateway to strengthening international cooperation and community development.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/africa/angola-biden-slavery.html\n\nhttps://www.phillytrib.com/news/why-black-americans-searching-for-their-roots-should-look-to-angola/article_c3e9207c-f9c3-5a2b-8caa-635a8497a566.html\n\nValue proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge?

This isespecially evident in areas like AI, blockchain, and user-centered digital design. As a result, many innovation initiatives stall due to limited technical follow-up. At the same time, rising internal demand for digital expertise highlights both growing awareness and the urgent need for structured capacity-building.\n\nIn the Argentine public sector, structural and systemic challenges are also reflected in quantitative evidence.

While usability and transactional functionality received relatively higher scores—0.62 and 0.69 respectively—the average for data governance was markedly low, at just 0.34. This highlights the critical underdevelopment of strategic data management practices at the local level. The study also revealed that only two-thirds of the municipalities surveyed had established any kind of local regulatory framework for digital policy. The remaining third operated under provincial or national laws, lacking local norms to guide key areas such as artificial intelligence, data ethics, or open data strategy.\n\nAt the national level, the scale of fragmentation is equally pronounced. In 2019, the Auditor General’s Office (AGN) reported that Argentina’s federal public administration was operating with 2,781 distinct IT systems across ministries and agencies. This level of technological disintegration significantly limits interoperability, causes duplication of data and effort, and hampers both service delivery and monitoring. The shortage of technical talent further compounds these challenges. Many municipalities report chronic difficulties in recruiting and retaining professionals with expertise in areas such as programming, data analysis, and digital infrastructure. Public sector salaries are often uncompetitive, and structured training or upskilling opportunities for existing staff are scarce.

This Action Plan is built precisely to respond to these limitations, working to close capacity gaps through a combination of internal development, strategic partnerships, and context-sensitive, people-centered innovation.\n\nIn addition to quantitative indicators, qualitative evidence gathered through fieldwork, interviews, and diagnostic processes reinforces the urgency and complexity of Argentina’s digital transformation challenges. These insights reveal not only structural and technological barriers, but also deeply rooted institutional and cultural dynamics that shape the country’s capacity to adopt and sustain digital innovation.\n\nAt the national level, research by organizations such as Fundar has shown that Argentina lacks centralized leadership for data governance and maintains no comprehensive inventory of public datasets. This results in significant ambiguity regarding which institutions produce specific data, how it is used, and under what standards. Even as transparency initiatives have led to the publication of open datasets, there are few institutional mechanisms in place to guarantee data quality, ensure interoperability, or promote strategic use.

Interviews conducted by CIPPEC with municipal officials reveal a widespread lack of coordination between departments, with most operating on isolated digital systems that do not share taxonomies, data models, or workflows. In practice, this results in fragmented service delivery, where citizens are forced to repeat procedures and information cannot be efficiently reused across agencies. Municipalities also report a persistent scarcity of technical personnel, particularly in areas like data science, software development, and AI application. The difficulty in hiring and retaining talent is exacerbated by low public sector salaries, limited career development opportunities, and a lack of internal training programs. While some local governments have begun to partner with universities or the private sector to address these issues, such initiatives tend to be informal and short-term, rather than part of institutional strategies.\n\nA concrete example of these limitations comes from the Province of Buenos Aires. Between September and November 2024, UNDP’s Accelerator Lab partnered with the Ministry of Community Development to conduct an in-depth assessment of its citizen request management system. Through interviews with front-desk staff, call center operators, social workers, request coordinators, and high-level officials, the diagnostic uncovered a highly fragmented structure. Different teams handled citizen requests independently, with little coordination, no shared protocols, and minimal use of integrated digital tools. Communication between teams often relied on informal channels such as WhatsApp or personal email accounts, raising concerns about data privacy and operational accountability. Many processes were tracked manually using outdated formats like Excel spreadsheets, making it difficult to monitor requests, follow up on unresolved issues, or analyze patterns to inform policy.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nTransform municipal services in Buenos Aires Province by improving coordination and digitalization across departments.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

In our work, we have found that resilience is not a fixed trait but a dynamic process that operates across individual, relational, and structural levels—and is deeply connected to well-being. \n\nA key foundation of resilience is the ability to feel connected, to belong. When social ties are weakened or absent, people's capacity to adapt, recover, and respond to adversity is significantly diminished. Unwanted loneliness, in this sense, is not just a personal or emotional experience—it is a public health concern.

These drivers are further compounded by technological overdependence, population aging, the long-term social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic—especially among younger populations—precarious labor conditions, shifting family dynamics, substance abuse, social pressure, and ageist narratives. \n\nOne thing is clear: we need to build community and think locally.

What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\nBuilding resilience through solidarity and shared purpose has emerged as a key strategy in a global context defined by uncertainty. Communities possess valuable knowledge about their environments and the opportunities they offer in times of crisis (UNDP, 2022a). Collective intelligence —through the open and structured exchange of ideas— presents a powerful opportunity to recover, amplify, and apply this knowledge. This collaborative approach can foster enabling conditions for resilience. That’s why our AccLab is exploring how people directly affected by challenges respond to them, aiming to understand the adaptive strategies they use and the conditions that either support or constrain their ability to respond effectively. \n\nSince 2023, the AccLab has been working on resilience in different ways, addressing a range of interconnected challenges through three qualitative research projects and one collective intelligence initiative.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nBuilding community and designing policies that strengthen social connection to enhance individual and collective capacities for resilience.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n* Continue exploring how people directly affected by challenges respond to them through qualitative research projects.\n* Analyze the adaptive strategies used by individuals and identify conditions that support or constrain their ability to respond effectively.\n* Develop a collective intelligence initiative to facilitate open and structured exchange of ideas among community members.\n\n**Resources Needed / Actors:**\n\n* AccLab team\n* Community members directly affected by challenges\n* Researchers and experts in resilience and social connection\n\n**Outcomes Achieved (if noted):**\nNot specified in the provided document, but potential outcomes could include:\n* Development of effective policies to strengthen social connection and enhance individual and collective capacities for resilience.\n* Identification of adaptive strategies used by individuals to respond to challenges.\n* Establishment of a collective intelligence initiative that fosters community engagement and knowledge-sharing.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n* The importance of understanding the complex web of factors driving loneliness and building resilience.\n* The value of community-led initiatives in addressing social connection and promoting collective capacities for resilience.\n* The need for ongoing research and analysis to identify effective strategies for strengthening social connection and enhancing individual and collective capacities for resilience.\n\n**Follow-up Actions / Monitoring Suggestions:**\n\n* Regularly assess the progress of the AccLab's research projects and collective intelligence initiative.\n* Monitor the impact of policies designed to strengthen social connection on community members' lives.\n* Continuously engage with community members and experts to gather feedback and refine strategies for building resilience.", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Building resilience, threatened by unwanted loneliness", "chunk_index": 1, "chunk_chars": 1853, "generated_by": "llama3.2", "generated_at": "2025-09-03T16:40:29.168662Z", "gen_config": {"max_new_tokens": 512, "temperature": 0.0, "stream": false}}}

Core themes include the importance of mental health, fulfilling activities, and social and family support, as well as skepticism toward institutions and the need for effective state responses. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified feelings of disconnection and uncertainty, accelerating digitization while also revealing new vulnerabilities. Despite this, participants shared hopeful views of risk as an opportunity for transformation, linking resilience to creativity, autonomy, and future aspirations. The study identifies four key dimensions shaping resilience: mental health, the ambivalence of digitization, the value of community-based responses, and the demand for meaningful institutional action. At the heart of these findings lies a call to address disconnection—within oneself, with others, with nature, and with political leadership—making unwanted loneliness a relevant and timely area for further exploration and policy innovation. \n\nThe third initiative involved a solutions mapping exercise on access to justice for persons with disabilities, as part of a UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund initiative in collaboration with UNDP Argentina’s Democratic Governance cluster, UNICEF, WHO/PAHO, OHCHR, UNFPA, and UNHCR.

In response, they engage in a gradual and dynamic process of specialization, often beginning with solitary, self-directed efforts that evolve into deeper knowledge and more effective advocacy for their rights.

Together, we identified unwanted loneliness as a shared area of concern. Increasingly recognized as a public health issue, unwanted loneliness is often referred to as a modern epidemic—one that demands not only targeted interventions but also preventive and community-based responses. In this context, the involvement of local communities is essential to designing effective and contextually relevant solutions.\n\nThe complex interplay of various insecurity factors is becoming more evident. \n\nThese acute crises are giving way to chronic,  interconnected uncertainties on a global scale, creating a sense of unsettled lives and an uncertain future (2022a) [Figure 1]. Consequently, feelings of insecurity are rising across the globe [Figure 2].\n\nIn this uncertain context, where many people are experiencing distress, the focus on unwanted loneliness emerges as a timely and relevant issue—one with the potential to grow in importance and impact. Unwanted loneliness is a subjective, unwelcome feeling of lack or loss of companionship, which happens when we have a mismatch between the quantity and quality of social relationships that we have, and those that we want. It is often associated with social isolation, but people can and do feel lonely even when in a relationship or when surrounded by others.\n\nLoneliness affects people of all ages and from all backgrounds – from the school child who struggles to make friends, to the new parent coping alone, to the older person who has outlived her friends and immediate family. Feelings of loneliness affect us all at some point, but being lonely can become a serious problem when it becomes chronic – a day to-day reality which, over time, can grind us down, affecting our health and wellbeing and damaging our ability to connect with others.", "output": "Here is the summary of the action plan:\n\n**Action Goal:** Building resilience against unwanted loneliness in local communities.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Studies have found relatively consistent levels of chronic loneliness among older people – with between five and 15 per cent reporting that they are often or always lonely. However, we have much less robust data on loneliness among children, young people and adults of working age.\n\nSome recent surveys have uncovered levels of loneliness across all ages that are worryingly high. What we don’t yet know is if this is a sign of a growing problem, or because efforts to breakdown the stigma of loneliness are working, making people more willing to acknowledge their loneliness. Whichever it is, there is much to do (European Commission, 2018).\n\nThe most relevant factors associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing loneliness include, having a low level of education, living in incomplete nuclear or single-person households, perceiving financial hardship (feeling their income is insufficient), facing functional health limitations, lacking social support networks, not participating in formal or informal activities, not working, and not using the internet (GCBA, 2019)\n\nWe mapped 69 international initiatives addressing unwanted loneliness. Several key patterns emerged:\n\n• They adopt a community-centered approach, fostering social connection through networks, cultural activities, and the use of public spaces.\n\n• They promote intergenerational exchange, strengthening learning and solidarity across age groups.\n\n• They integrate urban planning strategies, designing public spaces that encourage interaction, ensure accessibility, and include green areas that promote well-being and a sense of belonging.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nBuilding resilience to unwanted loneliness among children, young people, and adults of working age in the UK.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Located at the confluence of the Cuanza and Lucala rivers, it has potential for cultural and ecological tourism, connecting with pre-colonial heritage and the slave trade. The site includes historic monuments, and there are efforts to preserve and enhance the heritage, with the potential to make it a key tourist destination. Historical evidence reveals a direct connection between early African-American families and records of enslaved individuals who trace their origins to Angola. Massangano was an important departure point for those who were taken to the Americas. In 1619, the first Africans from Angola arrived on the shores of Hampton Roads. It is estimated that over 12 million Americans in the United States are of Angolan descent. The Tucker family is descended from the first Africans enslaved in North America. The William Tucker 1624 Society intends to continue collaborating with the Government of Angola in various areas. Promoting tourism with a focus on Afro-descendant culture in Angola can be a gateway to strengthening international cooperation and community development.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/world/africa/angola-biden-slavery.html\n\nhttps://www.phillytrib.com/news/why-black-americans-searching-for-their-roots-should-look-to-angola/article_c3e9207c-f9c3-5a2b-8caa-635a8497a566.html\n\nValue proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge?

This experiment also showed a willingness for mothers to transition towards these alternatives. The same study showed that willingness to pay among mothers and caregivers was a lower that market prices, at E60 ($3) per nappy compared to the market price ranging between E146 ($8)  and E173 ($10) per nappy. Municipal councils are also reluctant to collect this type of waste as it significantly reduces the lifespan of landfills. An innovation challenge undertaken as part of this experiment did not yield any useful results in terms of managing single use diaper waste, hence a need to deal with this type of waste upstream. This challenge is driven by the fact that most babis in the country exclusively use diapers without having access to proper waste management systems such as waste collection services and disposal and/ or recycling mechanisms. \nStakeholders involved in this challenges include: communities, caregivers, municipalities, EEA, Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Ministry of Health, Ministry Tinkhundla Administration and Development, Ministry of Finance, Eswatini Revenue Service, Retailers.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nManagement of Single Use Diapers 2.0 aims to increase awareness and adoption of sustainable alternatives like re-usable diapers among caregivers in Eswatini, while addressing the challenges associated with managing single use diaper waste.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

The rapid diffusion of these innovations often outstrips the ability of policymakers to regulate effectively, integrate them into governance structures, and anticipate their societal impact. This challenge is driven by a combination of factors, including limited institutional capacity, fragmented policy frameworks, and a lack of structured cross-sector dialogue between government, private sector innovators, academia, and civil society.\nIn North Macedonia, as in many other countries, regulatory frameworks remain reactive rather than anticipatory, creating governance gaps that hinder both responsible innovation and equitable access to emerging technologies. In addition, there are specific EU accession related transpositions of EU laws/ or approximations needed. Key challenges include a slow adaptation of legal and ethical standards, insufficient digital skills among policymakers, and underdeveloped mechanisms for citizen engagement in tech governance. As a result, technological advancements often lead to regulatory blind spots, ethical dilemmas, and unequal distribution of benefits, exacerbating digital divides and limiting the potential of emerging technologies to drive inclusive development.

A critical challenge is the lack of formal systems for solid waste management, which is more pronounced in informal settlements. Additionally, there is a scarcity of dedicated areas for recycling material drop-off, and the absence of a governmental garbage removal system exacerbates the situation. Furthermore, the cooperative movement in Zanzibar has experienced periods of decline, particularly after the Cooperative Union of Tanzania underwent reforms in 1991, leading to weakened organizational and support structures. ​ijcrar.com+1academia.edu+1zanzibarinsiderbuzz.wordpress.comsemanticscholar.org\n\nThe current situation is characterized by inefficient waste collection, improper disposal methods, and limited recycling activities. This inefficiency contributes to environmental pollution, posing health risks to the community and diminishing the aesthetic appeal of the islands, which can adversely affect tourism—a vital component of Zanzibar's economy.

What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\nOriginally started in Tanga in response to the financial and social risks experienced by informal garbage workers, Taka Bima is the first microinsurance program for rubbish pickers in Tanzania. Designed under a collaboration between Taka ni Ajira Foundation, UNDP Accelerator Lab, and Jubilee Insurance, the project sought to give rubbish pickers financial protection, social security, and better working circumstances. Taka Bima has shown success in improving financial resilience among waste pickers since its founding by providing reasonably priced insurance coverage catered to their demand (UNDP, 2023).", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nScaling Taka Bima microinsurance to waste pickers in Dodoma with customized involvement techniques, creative payment models, and closer linkages with local government and cooperatives.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n* Customized involvement techniques for Dodoma's socioeconomic and waste management scene\n* Development of creative payment models\n* Establishment of closer linkages with local government and cooperatives\n\n**Resources Needed / Actors:**\n\n* Collaboration between Taka ni Ajira Foundation, UNDP Accelerator Lab, Jubilee Insurance, and local government and cooperatives in Dodoma\n* Customized involvement techniques and creative payment models development team\n* Local government and cooperative representatives\n\n**Outcomes Achieved (if noted):**\nNot specified in the provided document.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n* The importance of customized involvement techniques for successful adaptation to new regions.\n* The need for creative payment models that cater to the specific needs of waste pickers in Dodoma.\n\n**Follow-up Actions / Monitoring Suggestions:**\n\n* Regular monitoring of the project's progress and impact on waste pickers in Dodoma\n* Evaluation of the effectiveness of customized involvement techniques and creative payment models\n* Continuous collaboration with local government and cooperatives to ensure sustainability and scalability.", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Scaling Microinsurance for Waste Pickers", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1941, "generated_by": "llama3.2", "generated_at": "2025-09-03T16:46:32.586456Z", "gen_config": {"max_new_tokens": 512, "temperature": 0.0, "stream": false}}}

Unlike Tanga, where well-organized garbage aggregation systems exist, Dodoma's waste industry stays mostly unorganized with scattered collecting and disposal methods. Financial fragility, limited insurance awareness, legal restrictions, and scalability issues all drive this difficulty (Taka ni Ajira Foundation, 2024). Dodoma's waste pickers are typically not financially literate and are reluctant to take insurance since they view it as unreliable or difficult. Furthermore, the lack of organized garbage cooperatives raises questions regarding the long-term viability of the project since it makes collective premium payments challenging.\n\nMoreover, institutional and legal obstacles impede fit into current social protection systems. Although the Tanzanian government has underlined financial inclusion via policies such the National Financial Inclusion Framework (NFIF) 2018–2022, informal workers are mostly left out of official insurance schemes (Bank of Tanzania, 2022). Adapting Taka Bima to this new terrain will depend critically on the Dodoma Municipal Council, local rubbish collectors, and financial institutions as well as on other factors.\n\nDodoma's waste pickers work without any kind of financial protection right now, which causes unstable income, poor access to healthcare, and dangerous working circumstances. A sudden medical emergency or accident might cause great financial difficulty, therefore aggravating poverty and economic uncertainty. Since they remain outside municipal garbage policies and official labor systems, the lack of insurance further reduces their negotiating strength. Furthermore, mistrust of official financial services implies that many waste pickers keep depending on unofficial savings systems, which lack long-term security (World Bank, 2023).", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nScaling Taka Bima to Dodoma, Tanzania, to provide financial protection and improve the lives of waste pickers in the city.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Important learning questions will probe adoption challenges, financial models, legal issues, and how technology could improve accessibility. The knowledge gained from this expansion will guide a national road map for including rubbish pickers into Tanzania's larger circular economy and social protection programs. By means of strategic alliances, creative business models, and community-driven participation, Taka Bima can establish a scalable and sustainable financial safety net for rubbish pickers spread around Tanzania.\n\nAlthough they have great difficulty, informal  waste pickers are absolutely vital in managing urban waste in Tanzania. Only 1.8% of waste pickers have health insurance; 88% of waste pickers finance their healthcare out-of-pocket according to a 2023 survey spanning eight areas including Dodoma. Their lack of financial security makes them susceptible to financial difficulties resulting from health emergencies. Insurance coverage is still poor nationally; just 6.3% of the adult population had official insurance in 2009, but unofficial insurance use is almost 2%. Although Dodoma generates around 350 tons of solid garbage every day, only roughly 184 tons are collected through official services. Collecting valuable items such plastic bottles (86.2%), plastic containers (66.5%), and metals (55.8%), informal rubbish pickers help to close this gap. Even with their contributions, women frequently operate in dangerous environments without protective gear, which increases health risks and injuries. Acknowledging their critical importance in trash management, scaling microinsurance projects like Taka Bima in Dodoma is crucial to guarantee these workers financial stability and healthcare.", "output": "Here's a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nScaling Taka Bima to Dodoma to provide financial protection mechanisms for informal garbage workers, specifically waste pickers, in Tanzania.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

A 2023 survey revealed that over 50% of waste pickers earn below the poverty line, with 35% making between TZS 3,000 to TZS 5,000 daily, equivalent to USD 1.11–USD 1.85. This economic hardship limits their access to essential services like health insurance. Additionally, Dodoma's rapid urbanization has led to inadequate waste management infrastructure, resulting in illegal dumping and environmental degradation. Despite their significant contributions to waste management, waste pickers often face stigmatization and lack formal recognition, exacerbating their vulnerability. These factors collectively emphasize the critical need for interventions that provide financial security and social support to waste pickers in Dodoma.\n\nValue proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge?

What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\n\nIn Guatemala, investing in circular economy initiatives presents both immense potential and significant barriers. The high upfront costs required for infrastructure and technology make these investments accessible only to wealthy investors or governments capable of securing large loans. Projects such as hydroelectric dams, water treatment plants, recycling facilities, as well as environmentally friendly production of food and other goods or services highlight the challenge. \n\nFor example, constructing a hydroelectric dam can cost millions of dollars, and while it is profitable and in the long term, the immediate benefits are often concentrated in specific stakeholders, such as energy companies, while the social and environmental costs -like displacement or ecosystem disruption- fall on local communities. This asymmetry in benefits frequently results in resistance, as seen with several hydroelectric projects in Guatemala that were vandalized or opposed by communities who felt excluded from their benefits.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided input:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nLower the high entry barriers to Circular Economy investments and practices, enabling broader participation and accelerating their implementation.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n* Identify potential solutions to reduce upfront costs for infrastructure and technology\n* Develop partnerships with local communities, governments, and organizations to increase access to resources and expertise\n* Conduct feasibility studies for circular economy projects in Guatemala\n* Establish a pilot program to test and refine the new approach\n\n**Resources Needed / Actors:**\n\n* Local community representatives\n* Government officials\n* Organizations specializing in circular economy and sustainable development\n* Financial institutions willing to provide loans or grants\n* Technical experts in infrastructure and technology\n\n**Outcomes Achieved (if noted):**\n(No outcomes have been achieved at this stage, as the plan is still in development)\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n* The importance of engaging with local communities and involving them in the decision-making process\n* The need for partnerships between governments, organizations, and private sector entities to access resources and expertise\n* The potential benefits of pilot programs in testing and refining new approaches\n\n**Follow-up Actions / Monitoring Suggestions:**\n\n* Regularly meet with local community representatives and government officials to monitor progress and gather feedback\n* Conduct quarterly reviews of the pilot program to assess its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement\n* Establish a network of stakeholders to share best practices and lessons learned\n* Continuously evaluate and refine the approach based on emerging challenges and opportunities", "metadata": {"source_type": "action_plan_platform", "source_filename": "action_plan_platform.csv", "title": "Circular Economy Investments powered by AI and Blockchain", "chunk_index": 0, "chunk_chars": 1972, "generated_by": "llama3.2", "generated_at": "2025-09-03T16:49:55.559920Z", "gen_config": {"max_new_tokens": 512, "temperature": 0.0, "stream": false}}}

A small community recycling center, for example, can cost tens of thousands of dollars to establish, requiring land acquisition, machinery, and operational costs. Yet, the immediate financial returns are often slow, and the benefits -such as reduced environmental pollution- are spread across broader society rather than providing direct, tangible gains to individual contributors. This creates a collective action problem: individuals or small groups are unlikely to invest unless there are immediate returns and guarantees that others will also contribute. \n\nCompounding this challenge is the tendency for financing to support consumption rather than investment. For instance, remittances in Guatemala are often used to expand homes or purchase consumer goods rather than fund productive, sustainable projects like composting centers or irrigation systems. These consumption-driven choices limit the creation of shared assets that could yield long-term environmental and economic benefits.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nEstablish a small community recycling center to promote circular economy efforts in a sustainable manner, leveraging AI and Blockchain technologies.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Tokenization allows large-scale investments to be divided into smaller, tradable digital tokens, enabling broader participation and ownership. Globally, we have seen initial applications of blockchain in renewable energy projects, such as tokenizing solar farms, where individuals can buy tokens representing a share of the energy produced. In Guatemala, early steps have been taken to tokenize real estate and solar panel production projects. For instance, local developers are experimenting with tokenized ownership of solar installations, allowing individuals to invest in a fraction of the panels and receive returns proportional to the energy generated. This model democratizes access, reduces reliance on single high-capital investors, and ensures that benefits are shared more equitably. \n\nAdding to these developments, artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to play a critical role in addressing the challenges of circular economy investments. AI-powered systems can enhance the efficiency and scalability of circular economy projects by optimizing operations and identifying opportunities for cost reduction. For example, AI algorithms can analyze energy usage in solar farms or irrigation systems, ensuring optimal performance and reducing waste.

Smart contracts integrated with AI can automatically verify compliance with agreements, distribute benefits equitably, and resolve disputes based on predefined rules, reducing reliance on Guatemala’s often weak justice system. Additionally, AI-driven platforms can improve accessibility by creating personalized user experiences and simplifying complex tokenization systems, making them easier for non-technical users to adopt.\n\nDespite these promising developments, challenges remain. Tokenization and AI technologies are not yet practical for widespread use. Legal frameworks and tax regulations for digital assets are unclear, and business models that ensure profitability and scalability for circular economy projects need to be refined. Moreover, community adoption depends on addressing the asymmetry of costs and benefits.

Without a robust social security system or widespread formal employment, most people prioritize short-term consumption over long-term savings or investment. For many, saving money is not an option, because there is no safety net to rely on in times of need. Instead, people channel their earnings into immediate experiences, such as dining out or purchasing consumer goods like clothing and electronics. Remittances, which constitute a major source of income for many families, are often used to buy vehicles, expand or renovate homes, or travel. While land purchases are culturally valued as a way to safeguard savings, this practice “parks” capital rather than circulating it productively within the economy, further limiting opportunities for collective investment in sustainable projects. \n\nAnother significant barrier is the pervasive lack of trust in Guatemala’s social and institutional structures. Interpersonal trust is low, making it difficult for individuals to embark on joint investments or collaborate on collective ventures. This is exacerbated by a weak justice system that struggles to enforce contracts or resolve disputes, creating additional risks for those considering cooperative efforts. While cooperatives provide some degree of trusted financial services, their scope is largely limited to saving and lending, and they do not facilitate more complex investment ventures, such as financing for circular economy projects.", "output": "Here's a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nEstablish access to financing for circular economy investments in Guatemala, addressing the barriers of insecurity, lack of trust in social and institutional structures, and limited financial options.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Projects like composting facilities, recycling plants, or agricultural waste management systems often lack reliable revenue streams or well-stablished frameworks for generating returns. Potential investors are hesitant to commit resources without a clear understanding of how these projects will become profitable. This uncertainty further compounds the challenges for those seeking to implement sustainable practices. \n\nAdding to these issues is the difficulty of adopting and implementing the necessary technologies. Circular economy projects often require integrating multiple systems, such as blockchain-based tools for tokenization or energy efficient technologies, which demand a level of technical expertise that is not widely available. The lack of prepackaged, user-friendly solutions means that individuals and organizations must navigate complex technological processes, which can be a significant barrier, particularly in rural or underserved areas with limited digital literacy. \n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) offers potential to address several of these challenges but also highlights additional gaps in adoption. AI systems can optimize operations for circular economy projects, such as managing energy consumption in solar installations or improving the efficiency of recycling processes.

In Guatemala, there is limited awareness of the long-term benefits of circular economy practices, and many people view sustainability as an additional cost rather than an opportunity. This mindset, coupled with the economic necessity of prioritizing immediate needs, makes it difficult to shift behavior toward more sustainable practices. Informal markets, which dominate much of the economy, further complicate efforts to scale up circular economy initiatives, as affordability and short-term gains often take precedence over efficiency or sustainability. \n\nFinally, Guatemala’s policy and regulatory environment does little to encourage circular economy investments. There are few incentives, such as tax breaks or subsidies, to support sustainable initiatives. Moreover, the legal framework for innovative financial instruments, like blockchain-based tokenization or AI-enhanced investment models, is underdeveloped, creating uncertainty for those looking to implement these solutions. Tokenization offers the potential to democratize access to circular economy investments by dividing large projects into smaller, tradable digital tokens that enable broader participation. AI can further enhance these models by improving decision-making, streamlining processes, and offering transparency.

However, pollution, deforestation, and poor waste management continue to degrade the natural resources on which these industries depend, threatening both environmental health and economic stability.  \n\nCircular economy practices, while essential, are difficult to adopt due to a combination of factors. A lack of knowledge about their benefits and implementation, high upfront costs, and low perceived immediate returns create significant barriers.

While Guatemala’s contribution to global climate change is negligible, the country faces increasing vulnerability to the effects of climate change, particularly the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Environmental degradation exacerbates this vulnerability, making it much harder for the country to adapt effectively. Without sustainable practices, the resilience of ecosystems and communities is further undermined, leaving Guatemala ill-equipped to cope with the impacts of climate change. Environmental degradation has already begun to compromise access to natural resources that are vital for the economy, food production, and societal functioning. Deforestation, water pollution, soil contamination, and declining air quality are creating cascading challenges across multiple sectors. The availability of clean water is particularly critical and increasingly precarious. Watersheds and rivers are polluted at alarming rates, threatening both rural and urban communities’ access to clean water for drinking, agriculture, and industry. Similarly, the pollution and depletion of soil resources are undermining the country’s agricultural productivity, a strategic resource for Guatemala’s economy and food security. The consequences of poor waste management are also mounting. Existing dump sites are nearing or have already reached capacity, collapsing under the strain of unchecked waste production. The lack of functional infrastructure for waste treatment and recycling is accelerating environmental damage and creating immediate health and safety risks for nearby communities.

Under the existing framework, circular economy investments are primarily accessible to wealthy investors or larger organizations, leaving out small businesses and lower-income communities. These groups are often unable or unwilling to bear the upfront costs or the operational burdens associated with adopting sustainable practices. This inequitable distribution of costs and benefits creates significant social tensions, particularly when individuals and communities are expected to adapt without adequate support or access to the opportunities created by the transition. This dynamic as the potential to fuel social conflict, as communities resist measures they perceive as unjust or overly burdensome. For instance, limitations on waste disposal or water use imposed without corresponding access to sustainable alternatives could spark widespread discontent. Similarly, if the economic benefits of circular economy practices are concentrated among a privileged few, public support for the transition will erode, further polarizing society and hindering progress. In sum, delaying the adoption of circular economy practices exacerbates Guatemala’s vulnerability to climate change, depletes the natural resources that underpin its economy and society, and increases the likelihood of social conflict.

While this progress is a positive milestone, it has led to a significant decline in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as international donors shift their focus to lower-income nations. As a result, UNDP Viet Nam and the Accelerator Lab must explore alternative funding models to sustain our work in driving innovation for sustainable development. \n\nThis challenge is further compounded by a global decline in international development funding, as donor priorities shift towards domestic concerns and emerging global crises.

While this has created a temporary bureaucratic freeze, there are emerging policy opportunities, particularly with Resolutions 57 and 03, which signal a strong governmental push for science, technology, and innovation (STI). This shift presents a window for the Lab to position itself as a key partner in Viet Nam’s innovation landscape. \n\nHowever, a fundamental challenge remains: Viet Nam’s government has historically not paid for UN services. Unlike the private sector or donor-funded initiatives, government institutions are accustomed to receiving ODA rather than using their own budgets to procure services from international organizations. This lack of precedent presents both a mindset and structural barrier to positioning UNDP and the Accelerator Lab as a viable service provider in innovation consulting. \n\nAs a result, the current situation produces several undesired effects: \n\n- Uncertain financial sustainability of the Lab beyond 2025, risking a loss of innovation capacity within UNDP Viet Nam. \n\n- Limited agility in responding to local needs, as reliance on donor funding dictates priorities rather than market-driven demand. \n\n- Missed opportunities for client partnership with the Vietnamese government, as existing UNDP support is often viewed through the lens of donor-funded technical assistance rather than as a strategic service offering. \n\n- To overcome these challenges, the Lab must navigate a fundamental shift in how it operates—transforming from a donor-dependent initiative into a financially sustainable, market-responsive innovation service provider.\n\nDeclining ODA and Shifting Donor Priorities:", "output": "Here is a summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nFinding Market-fit Service Offering for Vietnam AccLab to overcome challenges in financial sustainability, agility, and partnership with the Vietnamese government.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

This report details how key donors—including Japan, USAID, and the EU—are adjusting their portfolios, leading to significant reductions in concessional aid. Such recalibration underscores the urgency for Vietnam to explore alternative funding mechanisms to sustain its development agenda. \n\nInnovation Policy and R&amp;D Investment: \nRecent policy moves, such as Vietnam’s Resolution 57-NQ/TW (2023) and Resolution 03/NQ-CP (2024), aim to boost the nation’s innovation ecosystem by enhancing digital transformation and public–private partnerships. Meanwhile, World Bank data indicate that current R&amp;D investment is around 0.5% of GDP, with a target of 2% by 2030—an ambitious goal to drive sustainable economic transformation.\n\nOur existing relationship with government partner such as the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), the National Innovation Center (NIC), and provincial such as Danang and Hue hint at a growing interest in leveraging UNDP expertise for innovation consulting. This is something we have done for free in previous years, but it can be potential entry point for UNDP’s services. \n\nNew leadership in Vietnam and a strong push in innovation and technology such as with Resolution 57 and 03 in 2024-2025 to push investment in R&amp;D indicate a room of opportunity", "output": "Here is the summary of the action plan:\n\n**Action Goal:** Finding Market-fit Service Offering for Vietnam AccLab\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?\nThe UNDP Accelerator Lab Viet Nam brings a unique, systems-focused approach to innovation that sets it apart from traditional development actors, private sector consultancies, and government agencies. Our five years of on-the-ground experimentation, deep contextual knowledge, and global network of 90+ Labs uniquely position us to tackle this challenge. \n\n1. A Proven Track Record in Innovation &amp; Experimentation \n\nThe Lab has pioneered lean experimentation, solutions mapping, and systems thinking to address complex challenges in circular economy waste management, digital transformation, and public sector innovation. \n\nUnlike traditional UNDP country programs, which focus on policy advocacy and large-scale interventions, the Lab is agile, adaptive, and iterative—able to prototype, test, and refine innovation models before scaling. \n\n2. Bridging the Gap Between Government, Development, and Market-driven Innovation \n\nThe Vietnamese government recognizes the need for innovation but lacks the internal capacity to design and execute human-centered, experimental approaches. \n\nPrivate sector consultancies provide innovation services but are often detached from local development needs and lack a sustainability lens. \n\nThe Accelerator Lab operates at the intersection of these two spaces—leveraging UNDP’s policy credibility while offering the agility and problem-solving mindset of a start-up. \n\n3.

However, poor stakeholder coordination and data gaps hinder progress in this sector. The Travel &amp; Tourism Development Index 2024 ranks Bangladesh the lowest in South Asia for policies enabling sustainable tourism development, underscoring urgent reform needs. To establish Bangladesh as a sustainable and inclusive global tourism hub, the Bangladesh Tourism Board (BTB) developed a 25-year Master Plan. Data gaps in areas like sustainable tourism, traditional local products sources and visitor expectations led to a strategic collaboration between BTB and UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab for informed policy development and implementation.\n\nIn Bangladesh, tourism sector contributes slightly greater than 3% in the national GDP, whereas Maldives one-third of the national GDP is contributed by the tourism sector. Approximately, 5 million people are directly or indirectly engaged in the tourism sector of Bangladesh and additional 2 million workforce will be added in this sector gradually within 2030. Despite immense potential and natural resources, Bangladesh is unable to reap the full benefits of tourism due to lack of centralized data framework and a holistic tourism plan.\n\nhttps://www.undp.org/bangladesh/blog/mapping-tourists-mind-introduce-and-nurture-data-driven-decision-making-culture-tourism-sector-creating-informal-employment", "output": "Here is the summary of the action plan based on the provided document:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nEstablish a sustainable and inclusive global tourism hub in Bangladesh by developing a 25-year Master Plan, leveraging AI-powered data framework to address data gaps and inform policy development.\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

Each group plays a specific role in gathering, analyzing, and responding to data, but the effectiveness of their efforts is hindered by the disjointed nature of existing systems.\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nCurrently, the systems for monitoring social tensions are fragmented and lack the capability to provide a unified, real-time view of emerging risks. Similarly, needs assessments are often siloed and do not fully integrate the insights and input from local communities, especially marginalized and vulnerable groups. This results in interventions that may not be fully aligned with the actual needs on the ground.\n\nUndesired Effects:\n\nThe primary undesired effect of these challenges is the increased likelihood of escalating tensions due to missed opportunities for early intervention. When emerging risks are not promptly or accurately identified, preventive actions cannot be taken, potentially leading to conflicts that could have been mitigated or avoided. Additionally, the lack of effective participatory needs assessments means that recovery and development efforts may not effectively address the most pressing community needs, leading to less efficient use of resources and reduced impact of interventions.\n\n1.

It relies heavily on non-renewable energy sources, operates with insufficient infrastructure and has low adoption of advanced technologies. These factors increase production costs, limit operational efficiency and endanger food security and the economic sustainability of the sector.\n\nThe country's vulnerability to climate change exacerbates these problems, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions to strengthen resilience in agri-food production. Addressing these challenges requires a gender-sensitive approach and disaggregated data to develop more effective and inclusive measures.\n\nOne of the biggest gaps in the agri-food sector is the lack of accurate and up-to-date data on energy consumption, which makes it difficult to make informed decisions and implement effective energy efficiency policies.

(Please answer in specific terms: \"Our challenge is that...”.)\nThe widespread use of plastic bags in plant production contributes significantly to environmental degradation through waste accumulation, soil contamination and microplastic pollution. The challenge is to move away from these single-use plastics to sustainable, environmentally friendly alternatives that provide the necessary protection and functionality for plant growth, while ensuring cost effectiveness and long-term agricultural sustainability.\n\nBackground: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\nIn Cape Verde, the excessive use of plastic bags in the plant production sector, whether endemic, forestry or fruit trees, is a major environmental challenge.\nHistorically, the use of non-biodegradable single-use plastic bags in the plant production sector has been widely promoted in the archipelago due to their easy availability, ease of use, affordable cost and lack of knowledge about sustainable alternatives.\nThe reliance on the use of these plastic bags in nurseries has contributed to increased pollution and potential degradation of sensitive ecosystems and habitats, such as those found in the country's network of protected areas.", "output": "Here is a summary of the action learning plan:\n\n**Action Goal:**\nTowards a Plastic-Free Future: A Learning Plan for Sustainable Plant Production\n\n**Planned Steps / Timeline:**\n\n1.

From 18 May 2025, the introduction of single-use plastic products into the national market will also be banned.\nThe measure was taken to reduce environmental impact and promote more sustainable practices.\nSome data on the use of plastics in Cape Verde:\nPlastics make up almost a third of the waste in Cape Verde's landfills.\nPlastics can take between 100 and 500 years to decompose in nature.\nImproper disposal of plastics can pollute oceans, rivers and soil.\nPlastic incineration can release toxic gases.\nThe list of banned plastic materials includes\nNon-recyclable or non-biodegradable carrier bags\nDisposable tableware\nBottles smaller than half a litre\nPolystyrene containers for food and drink\nDisposable cutlery and plates\nBalloon sticks\n\nIn Cape Verde, several subtle but telling signals are pointing to the growing urgency of reducing the use of plastic bags in crop production. This urgency is further underlined by the recent government mandate to ban single-use plastics by 31 December 2024. This regulation reinforces the need to transition to sustainable alternatives in line with national environmental policies. Below are some qualitative indicators of this urgent challenge:\n\nCommunity observations and concerns:\nLocal residents and agricultural workers have observed growing accumulations of plastic waste around plant nurseries and near protected ecosystems.

Most courses were delivered virtually (59), followed by a combination  of virtual and in-person (12). This suggests the need to evaluate the\neffectiveness of training modalities and their learning impact.\n• The main topics addressed in the training include laws and policies on gender violence (35), gender focus in judicial decisions (29), and awareness and prevention of gender violence (25); however, only 12 judges have received training in victim intervention and support methods, which could indicate a significant area for improvement.\n\nConsidering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process?

The coastal regions of Bangladesh face a persistent cycle of disasters, including cyclones (e.g., Cyclone Amphan in 2020), tidal floods, and saltwater intrusion. While disaster preparedness has improved over the years with better early warning systems and cyclone shelters, challenges remain in ensuring resilience. Many embankments are breached annually, displacing thousands. The salinization of agricultural land has reduced crop yields, while coastal erosion destroys homes and infrastructure. Data from Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016 says 24.1% of households in the river char areas and 26% of households in the coastal char lands earn less than Tk. 7,000 monthly, while the national figure stands at 22.6%.

Recent examples include Cyclone Sidr (2007), which caused over 3,000 fatalities, and Cyclone Amphan (2020), which resulted in damages exceeding $13 billion (USD). Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) said that over 50% of coastal land in Bangladesh is affected by saltwater intrusion, reducing agricultural productivity by 15-20% annually. and crop yields for staples like rice have declined significantly in saline-prone areas, contributing to food insecurity for millions. However, it is a common phenomenon that the char dwellers always fight with the hunger, poverty, illiteracy, less farm productivity, climatic disaster, etc. Island people are poor, illiterate and deprived of employment opportunities and health facilities. According to World Bank, nearly 12 million people live in poverty in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. The existing fearful living of char dwellers and livelihood conditions, for instance, vulnerabilities arising from natural disasters such as flood, erosion, storm, cyclone, tidal surge; poverty, which is 2.7 times higher than the national average, and its consequent malnutrition; illiteracy; inadequate education, health and sanitation services; and limited rights to, if not absence of, land and livelihood resources, leave them in a never ending fight for survival.

However, it is surprising that these islands' potential is still hidden and that the islanders are not benefiting from it. The unprecedented environmental shock and limited opportunities for alternative livelihoods have put their lives in jeopardy. They don't have any specific business to support their family, except than farming and fishing. Usually, they barely make ends meet. Furthermore, due to their remoteness and inadequate infrastructure, the small island regions with their many issues are unable to participate in the advancement of global growth, leaving their economies in the dark.

Active involvement of residents and local actors fosters trust, a key element in overcoming the fragmentation of social cohesion in the neighborhood.\n\nBarriers to safety are multifaceted: The mapping identified various physical and socioeconomic barriers that hindered the sense of safety in Barrio Norte, such as poorly maintained public spaces, lack of lighting, areas of high violence, but also higher income areas where people felt excluded to go. Understanding these barriers allowed for the identification of priorities for improvement based on local concerns.\n\nLocal knowledge is essential for contextualizing interventions: Community insights, stories, and local perspectives provided a valuable lens for designing interventions. Residents had a nuanced understanding of their own challenges, which allowed the team to tailor recommendations to the specific needs, dynamics and history of the area, ensuring higher relevance and potential impact.\n\nDegradation of public spaces contributes to social isolation: The participatory mapping revealed how the design and maintenance of public spaces in Barrio Norte contribute to social fragmentation.

What undesired effects does it produce?\nIn Jordan, over 53% of the population faces food insecurity, exacerbated by climate change, droughts, and temperature fluctuations. The country’s dependence on food imports and resource scarcity, especially water, worsens the situation. The large refugee population also strains resources, with marginalized groups, such as women, youth, and refugees, disproportionately affected. These groups often play critical roles in food systems but face limited access to resources and opportunities, leading to poor nutrition, poverty, and environmental degradation.

(Please answer in specific terms: \"Our challenge is that...”.)\nIf you look around, you'll see plastic everywhere. Without going too far, you're probably reading this on your phone, tablet, or laptop, all of which contain plastic components. It's a material that has revolutionized our daily lives and seems to make everything easier. However, this convenience comes at a cost: just look at the rivers and streams in Panama City to see how tons of waste, mostly plastic, end up in the ocean. Or consider the fires at Cerro Patacón, our city's landfill and open-air dumps that make it hard for us to breathe. It's essential to shift from a produce, consume, and dispose model to a plastic circle that protects our ecosystems and our health.\n\nBackground: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?\nAt least 91% of the plastics we import are final products: flip-flops, containers, tables, or chairs. Between 2015 and 2019 alone, Panama imported an annual average of 160,704 tons of plastic raw materials, yet we lack sufficient environmentally responsible systems and mechanisms to manage and dispose of them at the end of their lifecycle.

However, individuals face a significant challenge in verifying the accuracy of all received news, which is an extremely time-consuming process. They need tools that help them access reliable information. \n\n- VULNERABILITY TO POOR INFORMATION INTEGRITY IS ASYMMETRICAL AMONG POPULATIONS: How people access and consume information varies greatly depending on who they are. Factors like their age, gender, the language they speak (especially for Indigenous populations), whether they have disabilities, and their level of education all play a role.

From unpaid salaries to losing a home to illegal detention. When facing troubles, where does one go to seek justice? Especially if courts are far away, legal advice is expensive and delays are painful? More than five billion people(link is external), around two-thirds of the world’s population, lack meaningful access to formal justice systems.At the same time governments and institutions are under growing pressure, with more demands and fewer resources. Justice systems are no exception. Despite playing a vital role in keeping societies fair and stable, they receive just 1.4 percent of global development assistance(link is external). But what if we could make justice work better, faster and fairer by doing things differently? Good practices are already there. UNDP’s Justice Futures CoLab and Accelerator Labs are helping surface and scale them. We piloted peer learning to enhance justice services on the ground. Innovation in actionRethinking how people experience justice is at the heart of innovation. Low-cost, people-centred initiatives are already reshaping justice services, with UNDP playing a leading role in co-developing and scaling these solutions in close partnership with national institutions and communities.In Ecuador, families affected by femicide worked with the Accelerator Lab to develop 'Flowers in the Air', a storytelling map that geolocates the stories of women who were killed. These powerful narratives are now used to train judges and prosecutors, helping shift attitudes about gender-based violence.

Now, we examine how experimentation is transitioning from one-off projects to a norm within UNDP, how it can become fully integrated into the core of UNDP's operations and functions, and how to contribute our learnings to the broader development ecosystem. The shift from periphery to coreFor experimentation to become institutionalized, it must move from the periphery of innovation teams into the core of programs, policies and decision-making frameworks. This shift can be understood through the lens of norm dynamics(link is external), a concept from international relations that explains how new practices become standard over time.  In norm dynamics, we track the emergence of norms (usually introduced by norm entrepreneurs who advocate for its adoption), to the norm cascade (more teams adopting experimental methods, creating momentum) and finally, internalization – when experimentation becomes widely accepted and expected. One pattern is increasingly clear within the Accelerator Labs Network: experimentation is transitioning from a new, emergent practice to an embedded norm within UNDP. It is referenced in strategic documents, reflected in new partnerships and supported by senior leadership.(link is external) This shift has been actively shaped by the Labs as agents of change (norm entrepreneurs) who have intentionally created the conditions for experimentation to take root.

Crowd-mapping is one such tool initially used for data collection but increasingly recognized for its ability to enhance participation and awareness.In Kenya, herder communities became “water scouts” and mapped over 1,200 water sources and 684 social amenities. In the Maldives, residents mapped island infrastructure to help manage disaster risk. Meanwhile in Guatemala, more than 400 volunteers mapped rural roads using satellite imagery, and a digital tool was developed to assess infrastructure risks from natural disasters using geographic coordinates. In North Macedonia, an open call for crowd-mapping led to the public mapping of water infrastructure in the capital, inspiring civil society organizations like the Scouts Association to replicate the experiment in another city. In Serbia, UNDP used alternative data—satellite imagery, telecom records, and citizen input—to analyze migration patterns, with findings that informed national policy.Experimentation leads to emerging themes in the sustainable development landscapeReflecting on our Network journey and codifying our work, we learned that Labs were not just running individual experiments, they were building interconnected portfolios of work, stitching together themes such as circular economy, climate resilience and inclusive governance.

Born in 1898, her cookbooks have sold more copies than the Bible in the country, reaching their 123rd edition, and it got translated into several languages — even Russian.In mid-20th century Argentina, millions of people learned how to use natural gas almost without realizing it. It didn’t happen through technical explanations, instruction manuals, or formal training. It happened through Doña Petrona. She never talked about valves, pressure, or energy efficiency. She taught people how to cook. And in doing so, she was also teaching them how to use a new energy source: natural gas. Making a shepherd’s pie or a homemade flan on live television became, unintentionally, a tutorial on how to light a burner, adjust the flame, or clean the stovetop. This kind of learning — rooted in everyday life and focused on what truly matters — is essential when we talk about technological innovation. Especially when that innovation is tied to basic rights, like access to energy.Between 2016 and 2017, over 4,000 solar water heaters were installed in social housing across the province of Jujuy, potentially reaching up to 16,000 people. These systems were specially designed to withstand the extreme temperature swings of the Puna region, with support from Fundación EcoAndina, an organization working with renewable energy since 1987. The goal was to harness solar energy as a tool to reduce energy poverty. This was a unique project for several reasons: its large scale, the geographic diversity of its implementation —spanning rural and urban areas, both small and large— and the wide range of infrastructure and socioeconomic conditions across the targeted communities. However, beyond the numbers and the magnitude of the logistical effort, the real question wasn’t how many devices were installed, but how many were actually used. \n Renewable Energy: The Work of UNDP’s Co-Lab", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe article highlights the importance of learning through everyday life and hands-on experience when it comes to technological innovation, particularly in the context of access to energy.

Through surveys with 129 households, 10 in-depth interviews, and one focus group, this research offered firsthand insight into how — or why not — renewable technologies are adopted in contexts of energy poverty.The project Sun at Home: What Works to Adopt Renewable Energy in Social Housing led to a field study whose results we’re pleased to share in this report. One of the main findings was that, despite overwhelmingly positive opinions, the actual adoption of solar water heaters was quite limited: only 7% of households used it as their sole source of hot water, 35% combined it with electric or gas systems, and the remaining 58% didn’t use it at all. You can read the full report here.Among those who didn’t use the system, many never installed it, gave it away, sold it, or fully disconnected it. The reasons were varied: technical issues (like low water pressure, poor orientation that didn’t capture sunlight, or poor installation or substandard materials), unstable water networks, and precarious housing conditions.Yet the biggest obstacle was something else: there was no training or follow-up. The solar heaters were delivered without any hands-on guidance, and the only support offered was a technical manual. As a result, people were left to figure things out on their own — or, at best, rely on neighbors for help. The findings from the Jujuy experience align with others we’ve seen regarding the persistent barriers to the effective adoption of renewable energy solutions. \n Video Player \n What Did We Learn from the Solar Water Heater Experience in Jujuy?", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post \"Renewable Energy Lessons From the Kitchen With Doña Petrona\" shares insights from a study conducted by the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Argentina on the adoption of solar water heaters in social housing.

But for that to happen, you need more than just the technology — you need support. When people don’t understand how the system works, they make do. When the heater is poorly oriented, the water doesn’t get warm. When there’s no pressure, there’s not enough for a proper shower. And when no one explains what to do with the steam during summer, the device becomes a hazard instead of a solution.Even so, some users came up with their own strategies: they came up with fixes like adding drainpipes to relieve pressure and prevent boiling, installed mixers to regulate temperature, cleaned the glass panels to improve heating, adjusted usage times, and shared tips with neighbors. They learned through trial and error — and taught each other along the way.People in Jujuy learned however they could. Back in the day, Doña Petrona had been hired by Argentina’s national natural gas company to promote the shift from wood-burning stoves to natural gas. But she didn’t teach about gas. She showed people how to enjoy life more one recipe at a time.. In the case of solar water heaters, the challenge isn’t just technical — it’s cultural. It’s not enough to hand out devices: you need to be present — to listen, adapt, and truly walk alongside people. You must build trust — not just infrastructure.In innovation processes and in the promotion of new technologies, it’s essential to create experiences where people learn by doing. Ensuring the adoption of renewable energy solutions isn’t just about installing a panel or a solar water heater — it’s about understanding and supporting the routines, knowledge, and habits of those who will use them. In other words, it’s about teaching people how to use them without it feeling like a lesson. Like Doña Petrona.

This practice, which was once guided by ancient codes of honour, has changed over time, turning into violent disagreements, conflict between communities, and the loss of livelihoods. Recognizing the urgency and complexity of the issue, the UNDP South Sudan Accelerator Lab in collaboration with the Roots of Generation (ROG), conducted a follow-up co-creation workshop designed to identify solutions from within the community.The initiative was built on an earlier visit in May 2024, when the Lab, along with staff from the UNDP- Africa Borderlands Centre (UNDP-ABC) and Life & Peace Institute, who had travelled from Kenya and Ethiopia, visited the area. The ABC is UNDP's larger assistance for cross-border peace initiatives in the Karamoja corridor, which includes South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia; a region where national borders are porous, but communities, cultures, and conflict are shared.Our trip back to Narus and Budi was more than just a continuation; it was a connection, strengthening of bonds, sharing of knowledge, and a celebration of local innovation.  \n\n Session with Kraal leaders: Mzee Loraca, during the Co-creation sessions in Narus.

From conversation to design. We led empathy mapping sessions, which used visual aids to analyze the words, thoughts, feelings, and actions of various actors in order to uncover more hidden truths. These conversations with various community groups were incredibly eye-opening. These maps turned into mirrors, reflecting a common burden and strong desire for peace and improved livelihood among the raided families, kraal youths, elders, and women. Communities were able to visualize the overlapping pain points and motivations by mapping the perspectives of local chiefs, mothers, herders, raiders, and even the cattle themselves (a metaphor that provoked both insight and laughter).This exercise surfaced emotional intelligence, the social and psychological effects of cattle raiding. The raided felt depressed, angry, unsettled, and frequently tempted to seek retaliation.

R&D allows for the prototyping of digital tools to scale these initiatives and connect them with the more formal financial system. For example, somebody’s participation in a neighborhood savings group — once digitally recorded — might be accepted by a regular bank as credit history, allowing that person to open a bank account and accessing credit. Early successes in South Sudan and Zambia showed that approaches combining digital technology and proximity networks of trust between neighbors can enhance financial inclusion. The R&D Rave on digital financial inclusion identified promising ways to build on such successes. For example, we discovered low trust in digital financial services, which is likely to slow down their uptake. The Accelerator Labs are considering a global hackathon to explore new ways of creating trust between communities and service providers.\nLearning from R&D on the circular economy: how waste management lays the groundwork for circularity\nUNDP and its Chemicals and Waste Hub take the view that it is no longer possible to separate the ”development and growth” agenda from the “environment and climate” one. Rather, economies must be transformed to incorporate environmental agendas. UNDP’s R&D work in this area has highlighted pathways to bootstrap circular ambitions into economies at various stages of industrial development. Solid waste management is one such path. Global Majority countries are awash in single-use plastics. As they set out to modernize waste management services, they become exposed to the idea of a circular economy. Unfortunately, information about the location, composition and circular potential of waste is often incomplete.", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\n\nThe blog post highlights the importance of R&D in addressing global challenges such as financial inclusion and environmental sustainability.

Once this information is organized — often in rich, complex maps, such as this one in Panama — opportunities emerge to make those economies more circular. Additionally, extending health insurance schemes to informal waste-pickers turns out to be a way to increase volumes and quality of collected waste, as well as to protect the health of vulnerable informal workers. In Tanzania, the Lab partnered with the Taka ni Ajira Foundation on the Waste Banks initiative which collects daily waste data from pickers and creates a credit score matrix based on the data. The result was a bespoke microinsurance product for informal waste pickers.\nR&D has also surfaced pathways to circularity in unexpected places, like the buildup of the industrial capacity of small businesses to close some materials loops (Mongolia), or the elevation of informal networks of waste pickers and sorters into full-fledged green businesses (Ethiopia).\nOur bottom-up R&D process pointed to several promising directions for future work to make the economy more circular. For example, the Accelerator Labs are looking to systematically map indigenous practices of sustainable resource management, and to learn from them. The idea is to develop an array of culturally intuitive practices that can be integrated into modern circular systems. Another promising direction is prototyping digital tokens to enable citizens to directly invest in “their” circular infrastructure — like community composting facilities or hydroponic agriculture systems.

Systems transformation is a hard task, but it need not be impossible. R&D offers a possible way forward. The UNDP Malaysia Accelerator Lab, for example, supported a marginalized community in Moyong, in the state of Sabah in 2021 when local producers lost access to the market due to COVID restrictions. The Lab responded by developing a simple e-commerce platform and supporting local businesses to learn to use it to sell their products online. Once that was up, and working well, those producers quickly realized that they were no longer limited to selling their products locally: they could ship anywhere — in theory. In practice, though, that meant getting the logistics right: long-distance shipping was quite expensive with respect to the price of the products themselves.\nTo address this problem, the Lab had the e-commerce platform pivot from retail to wholesale, to take advantage of economies of scale in shipping. Solving this challenge immediately created a new one: some processing was needed to lengthen the shelf-life of products, as well as increase their added value. In the case of dried fruit, one of the best-selling products, it became apparent that oven drying was too expensive and operated at an insufficient scale.\nPartnering up with the government of Japan, the Lab developed an open source solar dryer, ruggedized and optimized to operate in tropical climate. At this point, the local food system had become unrecognizable: their markets, business model, processing technology and value chain had all changed.

It does not break down a large problem into independent pieces that can be tackled one micro-intervention at a time. On the contrary, systems change in practice uses system connectedness as an asset. Each intervention leads the system into the next one, always keeping the Sustainable Development Goals as their north star, always working to open more opportunities where fewer, or none, existed before.\nAccording to French economist Thomas Piketty, bold reform needs social experimentation: start with an idea, test it in a sandbox, improve it, and iterate, until it’s ready for broader deployment.

In 2019, UNDP established a Sustainable Finance Hub(link is external) to better enable partners to accelerate financing for the Sustainable Development Goals. With 1.4 billion adults still lacking access to bank accounts(link is external), the Accelerator Labs’ work in this area has focused on financial inclusion. Just as the digital revolution is leading to financial institutions shutting down local branches and concentrating activities at headquarters, UNDP documented how proximity and community can enable inclusion. Traditional forms of community saving are present everywhere in the world, and even the poorest have access to them, simply because their neighbors know them well enough to share a common pot of savings. R&D allows for the prototyping of digital tools to scale these initiatives and connect them with the more formal financial system. For example, somebody’s participation in a neighborhood savings group – once digitally recorded – might be accepted by a regular bank as credit history, allowing that person to open a bank account and accessing credit. Early successes in South Sudan and Zambia(link is external) showed that approaches combining digital technology and proximity networks of trust between neighbors can enhance financial inclusion. The R&D Rave on digital financial inclusion identified promising ways to build on such successes. For example, we discovered low trust in digital financial services, which is likely to slow down their uptake.

They joined the waste management system change pilot, supported by UNDP Mongolia’s Accelerator Lab. UNDP Mongolia \n Learning from R&D on the circular economy: how waste management lays the groundwork for circularityUNDP and its Chemicals and Waste Hub  take the view that it is no longer possible to separate the ”development and growth” agenda from the “environment and climate” one. Rather, economies must be transformed to incorporate environmental agendas. UNDP’s R&D work in this area has highlighted pathways to bootstrap circular ambitions into economies at various stages of industrial development. Solid waste management is one such path. Global Majority countries are awash in single-use plastics. As they set out to modernize waste management services, they become exposed to the idea of a circular economy. Unfortunately, information about the location, composition and circular potential of waste is often incomplete.This has prompted many Accelerator Labs to localize illegal dumpsites; analyze the composition of waste streams; assess its recycling potential; map the daily runs of informal waste collectors. Once this information is organized – often in rich, complex maps, such as this one in Panama(link is external) – opportunities emerge to make those economies more circular. Additionally, extending health insurance schemes to informal waste-pickers turns out to be a way to increase volumes and quality of collected waste, as well as to protect the health of vulnerable informal workers. In Tanzania, the Lab partnered with the Taka ni Ajira Foundation on the Waste Banks initiative which collects daily waste data from pickers and creates a credit score matrix based on the data. The result was a bespoke microinsurance product for informal waste pickers.R&D has also surfaced pathways to circularity in unexpected places, like the", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post highlights the importance of learning from research and development (R&D) in systems transformation, particularly in the context of waste management and circular economy.

For example, the Accelerator Labs are looking to systematically map indigenous practices of sustainable resource management, and to learn from them. The idea is to develop an array of culturally intuitive practices that can be integrated into modern circular systems.

Systems transformation is a hard task, but it need not be impossible. R&D offers a possible way forward. The UNDP Malaysia Accelerator Lab, for example, supported a marginalized community in Moyong, in the state of Sabah in 2021 when local producers lost access to the market due to COVID restrictions. The Lab responded by developing a simple e-commerce platform and supporting local businesses to learn to use it to sell their products online. Once that was up, and working well, those producers quickly realized that they were no longer limited to selling their products locally: they could ship anywhere – in theory. In practice, though, that meant getting the logistics right: long-distance shipping was quite expensive with respect to the price of the products themselves. To address this problem, the Lab had the e-commerce platform pivot from retail to wholesale, to take advantage of economies of scale in shipping. Solving this challenge immediately created a new one: some processing was needed to lengthen the shelf-life of products, as well as increase their added value. In the case of dried fruit, one of the best-selling products, it became apparent that oven drying was too expensive and operated at an insufficient scale. Partnering up with the government of Japan, the Lab developed an open source solar dryer, ruggedized and optimized to operate in tropical climate. At this point, the local food system had become unrecognizable: their markets, business model, processing technology and value chain had all changed. In the space of 18 months, system change had happened. Notice how this process differs from the reductionist approach decried by economist Yuen Yuen Ang(link is external).

This journey aimed to establish new capabilities within the UNDP portfolio to support system transformation. One key area of focus within this portfolio was the Future of Work.Within the Future of Work portfolio, the \"Digital Inclusion and Future Skills Education Pilot\" emerged as a vital initiative. This pilot was designed to address the digital skills gap, especially among young women living in peri-urban and rural areas. These skills would not only open job opportunities but also strengthen self-owned businesses and ensure their sustainability.The pilot initiative was launched in the Municipality of Cacuaco, where a selected group of young people, particularly young women, were engaged in a cooperative supported by the AgriPREI Project, where they had access to training in food processing and transformation to start developing capacity to expand business opportunities.Looking at the potential of the cooperative and the youth that had been trained, UNDP came in with the project to provide access to basic digital tools and test a training package that included digital, management, marketing, and entrepreneurship skills tailored to young women in cooperatives. \n\n Figure 3: Storage room converted into a digital learning center, photo by Carlos César", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post highlights the importance of bridging the digital divide in rural areas to empower youth and build a brighter future.

Gender-based disparities are evident, with a notable percentage of women not using computers, while men exhibit a more varied distribution in computer usage. In mobile phone skills, women tend to have higher confidence, but both genders exhibit significant gaps in software and internet-related challenges. The gender divide is also felt in the attendance and participation in the training. Many young girls between 19 to 25 years old have month old babies that they need to bring to the class, while others are forced skip training sometimes due to childcare duties. While the pilot does not include dedicated childcare support, in future iterations this is critical to ensure equal access to training. Internet access is a crucial issue, with half of the participants relying on limited mobile data and others lacking access at home or work/school. This underscores the importance of affordable and widespread connectivity. The analysis of gender and technological skills reveals that women excel in specific areas but have fewer diverse skills compared to men. Both genders exhibit shortcomings in advanced skills, underscoring the need for accessible learning resources and support for all.The most common use of mobile phones is photography, with most participants mentioning that they take pictures every day or at least twice a week.

Symposium on Caribbean Arts & Heritage explored how the region’s creative sector is intersecting with A.I., a subject that is shaping discussions among school boards, production crews, libraries and artists alike. The live conversations with subject matter experts revealed a complex environment with challenges and opportunities ahead, many of which clustered around the following key themes that emerged for consideration:  \n\n  The Double-Edged Sword of A.I.Several panelists noted the many benefits that A.I. can bring to the Orange Economy in the Caribbean, including democratizing access to cultural heritage, enhancing arts education capacities and opening new markets for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Many of these positive shifts are already being seen, even if on a small scale. On the flipside, numerous risks were noted - with the potential for A.I. to exacerbate inequalities, further entrench biases, and threaten cultural diversity. From a security standpoint, ethical concerns around data use, privacy, and intellectual property were frequently raised. This resulted in a double-edged sword dynamic requiring proper stewardship to ensure the safe usage of A.I. for creative purposes.  2. Ethics, Equity and Human RightsMany emphasized that any application of A.I. in the arts sector should be firmly rooted in an ethical framework based on human dignity, cultural specificity, and inclusivity. This included calls for a transparent, fair and rights-based approach to A.I. regulation. Additionally, given that A.I. tools are often consumed rather than produced in the Caribbean, it was recognized that A.I. must be anchored in local values rather than those imported externally from global tech hubs. This reflects the reality that dominant A.I. systems typically include Western biases and exclude Caribbean perspectives.

These disruptions demand bold, practical efforts to reimagine how institutions can remain effective, inclusive, and resilient.While incremental adjustments sufficed in stable times, today's complexity demands institutional evolution. This isn't about starting from scratch, but building on what works, shedding what doesn't, and embracing new possibilities. Current approaches are often insufficient for today's challenges, failing to recognize necessary transformations.This calls for rethinking core purposes, structures, and operations. Institutions should become more participatory, integrating diverse perspectives and equitably distributing decision-making. They need to adopt regenerative principles that restore environmental and social systems, and develop resilience to withstand shocks, adapt, and transform. This institutional evolution requires bold leadership, systems thinking, and the courage to adapt established models for a sustainable and equitable future.The 2025 Istanbul Innovation Days (IID2025) (link is external)explored this urgent need.

It's a commitment to collective learning, ensuring transformative efforts endure. This framework is particularly useful for policy teams, public sector innovators, and development practitioners aiming to embed resilience in their work.Regenerative Thinking in Institutional DesignProf Eduard Müller, founder of Regenerate Costa Rica, encouraged us to move beyond just reducing harm, toward economic models that help restore people and the planet. Referring to Buckminster Fuller, he said: “Don’t fight the system. Build a better one that works.” Regenerative non-extractive economic models focus on giving back more than we take - from nature, communities, and future generations. Unlike traditional models that often exploit resources, regenerative models aim to rebuild ecosystems, strengthen local economies, and support long-term well-being. Müller’s principles for regenerative institutional thinking include:Design for Restoration: Restore ecosystems and social cohesion through policies and institutions.Embrace Systemic Thinking: Adopt a holistic perspective, mirroring living systems for integrated solutions.Cultivate the Capacity to Unlearn: Critically examine and discard practices that no longer serve social and ecological well-being. As Müller noted, “We don’t need to teach people more – we need to help them unlearn what no longer serves.”", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post \"Rethinking Institutions for a World in Flux\" presents a framework for creating resilient institutions that prioritize long-term value creation and delivery.

Centered on the principle “Data for self-determination,” it offers a values-based approach for public service agencies to govern Māori data ethically and align with Māori priorities. It outlines eight key Data Pou (pillars) covering areas like data protection, access, infrastructure, and workforce development, grounded in principles like accountability, decolonisation, and nurturing data as a sacred resource. The model calls for shared governance, legislative change, and strategic investment to enable genuine partnership and transform Aotearoa’s data ecosystem.Mikaere urged seeing data as a relationship shaped by care, context, and accountability.

Themes like irreversibility, relational governance, and regenerative thinking emphasized that enduring institutions require a fundamental shift: designing for lasting relevance, genuine connection and trust, and actively contributing to people and the planet's well-being.Cross-cutting themes deepened this horizon. Sessions on decision-making under uncertainty highlighted human cognition's role. We explored innovative governance roles like Chief Time Officers and Ministries of Loneliness. Conversations on informality and culture underscored that institutions run on relationships as much as rules. Bold provocations included multi-species collaboration, nature-informed intelligence, and strategic development intelligence.ID2025's insights emphasize that creating enduring institutions means evolving how we think, build, and relate. It's about embracing innovative designs that are irreversible in impact, trustworthy in operations, and regenerative in essence. This is the shared horizon: building institutions that thrive and foster a more resilient and equitable future.These ideas offer UNDP Accelerator Labs and Country Offices tangible lenses for navigating complexity.

Some issues raised included low digital literacy and a perception that AI was a “black box”. Additionally, Labs sometimes had to mitigate unrealistic expectations that AI could be applied to almost anything.Most Labs further reported that people, from TikTok content creators in Bangladesh to rural communities in Trinidad and Tobago, generally had mixed feelings about the deployment of AI, with perceptions varying from techno-optimism to considerable skepticism. The Lab in Belarus highlighted a general positivity towards AI, with almost 50% of respondents to a nation-wide survey they conducted reaching 11K people affirming they trusted AI — albeit in most cases, on the condition that they understood how the algorithms worked. The Lab in Trinidad and Tobago mentioned that cautious optimism was often met with healthy skepticism, with 62% of respondents to a survey they conducted in six different locations around the country reaching 211 people mentioning mixed feelings about AI, and a clear divide on whether to trust AI to make decisions that could affect human lives (46% trust versus 42% distrust). Finally, speaking specifically about small shop owners, the Lab in Ecuador stated that people perceived AI as somewhat irrelevant in their day-to-day lives.This is in part due to the challenge of discussing AI as a monolithic technology: it can lead to misrepresentations, unrealistic expectations, and misplaced trust or distrust. There is a dire need for clarity about the possibilities that AI systems can offer, as well as their limitations, in different contexts and for different populations, sectors, and institutions.

This can lead to insightful conversations about the perceived or anticipated implications of such applications. For example, the Lab in the Ukraine, reporting numbers from the Ministry of Digital Transformation’s White Paper on AI Regulation in the Ukraine, mentioned that 57% of the population were familiar with chatbots; the Lab in Paraguay claimed that civil society often associated AI with targeted ads; and the Lab in Bosnia and Herzegovina evoked some level of public awareness of more specialized applications like AI-assisted radiology and automated customer service.

The Lab in Ecuador further pondered how balancing sustainability with digital growth was a major challenge in the country.These international dynamics between private and public sectors raise important questions about balancing economic incentives — predominantly those of large, Global North conglomerates — and the global public good. There is a need to guarantee that the advantages of AI are distributed equitably, ensuring that those who contribute much of the primary resources such as data also benefit from the economic returns.Towards being more democratic about technologyBuilding trust and enabling greater agency over AI are critical endeavors. As UNDP actively works on re-imagining trust and safety for AI, we remain committed to including a plurality of voices from the Global Majority, as indeed, our collective technological futures should be a matter of choice. To this end, discrete consultations and engagements are necessary, but not enough. They need to be multiplied across all regions of the globe, even in places that may not be particularly AI ready and should be committed to “participation as justice,” i.e., a more continuous, long-term form of engagement that is based on mutual benefits, reciprocity, equity and justice.

One may experience the city from a place of privilege and enjoyment of its amenities, or from a place of deprivation and survival. Yet regardless of social class, local governments' basic responsibilities are a) to ensure all residents can access city amenities and services efficiently and affordably, b) that those services are citizen-centered, and c) that their voices are heard and included in local decision-making processes.\n\nOne of the most critical issues faced by cities in the developing world is that, as urban sprawl consolidates(link is external), there are persistent local governance issues predominantly in socioeconomically deprived zones. A case in point, in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), there is greater public demand for citizens’ participation in policy decision-making in tandem with a steady decline in public trust in governments throughout the region(link is external), due in part to a collective discontent generated by low participation.\n\nGood governance is fundamental (link is external)for a healthy democracy. Although its meaning and scope are debated and contested(link is external), as a working definition, I conceive of governance as the space of shared power and negotiation between institutions of government and the governed, in pursuit of the collective good. More specifically, for UNDP \"local governance comprises the set of institutions, mechanisms and processes through which citizens and their groups can articulate their interests and needs, mediate their differences and exercise their rights and obligations at the local level.\"", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\n\nThe article discusses the challenges and benefits of urbanization in developing countries, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Most often, a society's lowest strata possess the least bargaining power in making their voices heard. Indeed, UNDP has paid considerable attention to urbanization and inequality, arguing in a report that \"pro-poor urban governance\" is a critical requisite for cities and communities to be livable. For instance, research (link is external)shows that it is among the most economically deprived urban areas where violence and social dysfunction are most salient.\n\nGood governance can nourish a space for local civic engagement that results in positive change(link is external). Yet, social conflict and the struggle for limited resources can jeopardize a community's attempt to find common ground and compromise. In that sense, our ethnographic work in Santo Domingo has been enlightening on the complexities of local governance. While formal governance instruments exist (e.g., neighborhood associations, grassroots organizations, meetings with municipal authorities), community leaders and organizers often complain that their voices go unheard, government commitments unfulfilled, and inner political struggles among local leadership preclude communities from showing a united front on important issues.", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post highlights the challenges of dysfunctional urban local governance in marginalized communities.

Surely, cohesion and peaceful social interactions might be difficult when poverty, the lack of urban planning, overcrowding, and precariousness are some of the salient traits of community life. When conflict arises, even physical violence, it undermines community integration and disperses the social capital available. Social disorganization(link is external) weakens the bonds of solidarity and cohesion. As A. Portes(link is external) contends, the particular social ecosystems of slum neighborhoods are perfectly rational for people who live in marginality.\n\nOur argument here is that sociocultural arrangements and the psychosocial/behavioral repertoire of practices among community leaders and stakeholders influence governance and the ways a community's sociopolitical ecosystem is reproduced. Individuals tend to act according to what the resources and institutional practices permit them. Nonetheless, in our experience, plenty of slum community members(link is external) and leaders work tirelessly and generously for the greater good.

As a local leader once told me: \"I like working with you (UNDP) because you have been the only institution that takes us seriously in what we say.\"\n Establish neutrality and seriousness of purpose from the outset. Marginalized communities are used to seeing development projects as political mechanisms that generate support in local or national elections. Being perceived as working for one or the other side might slow or put implementation at risk. Further, finding leadership that puts political affiliation aside is necessary for true progress.\n Articulating local governance is a humbling experience for our often stratification-informed perceptions of knowledge and whose opinion matters. As an international development agency whose name carries a certain weight, textbook expertise does not fully prepare us to understand the social world of people at the margins and the subjectivities of their everyday lives.\n Governance is an iterative process.

Le Rapport sur le développement humain 2022 du PNUD décrit avec justesse un ensemble d’incertitudes, où de multiples tensions se renforcent mutuellement et compromettent le développement.\n Depuis plus de trois décennies déjà, le PNUD calcule l’indice de développement humain. C’était la première fois qu’il déclinait dans le monde pendant deux années consécutives. Nous avons été ramenés à 2016, lorsque nous avons commencé à mettre en œuvre les ODD. Personne n’a été épargné. Quatre-vingt-dix des pays ont vu cet indice baisser, une proportion impressionnante. Tous les pays sont confrontés aux incertitudes de l’économie et à l’inquiétude et l’insécurité généralisées. Et nous ne sommes pas au bout de nos peines.\n En dépit de ces obstacles – de leur fait en réalité, devrais-je dire – le PNUD n’a jamais marqué de pause. Partout dans le monde, nos équipes se mobilisent aux côtés des pays en développement partenaires pour aider à endiguer l’évolution de la pauvreté et continuer de faire avancer le développement.

Diverse institutions and organizations promote them as a way to stimulate creativity, collaboration, and rapid progress toward social and economic development(link is external).\nThe growing popularity of these methods has brought praise(link is external) of well-designed contests(link is external), as well as criticism (link is external)of their shortcomings (link is external)and recognition of the myriad(link is external) challenges(link is external) they face to be effective levers of innovation. Some of these challenges include Incorporating diverse perspectives(link is external) and experiences, making relevant knowledge(link is external) and resources(link is external) available, follow-up in the implementation of winning proposals, and evaluation of their impact. We believe that considering these challenges is particularly important when working on social innovation in vulnerable communities. \nSocial innovation is both the process and product of identifying solutions, tools, and ideas to respond to a specific social problem(link is external). As a process, social innovation  attempts to invert the power dynamic often present in traditional innovation policy, by insisting on collaborative, communal, relevant and public knowledge-generation directly with and from the affected communities.", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post \"Moirũ: what we learned integrating community participation and social innovation\" highlights the importance of considering challenges associated with innovation contests and challenges in vulnerable communities.

It demonstrated the power of “popular knowledge” in creating a diversity of proposals, as well as the importance of collective decision-making. Reflecting on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the challenge, it is evident that solutions mapping is effective for engendering innovative solutions to structural issues through collaboration and community engagement. The reframing workshop rapidly narrowed their focus and helped clarify what primary efforts to support SDG 2 and 5 were already underway.\nHowever, budget and timeline constraints pushed us to conduct the entire process in just under four months. Mapping solutions with broad and diverse participation requires more time. Analyzing and making sense of solutions mapped in this way, in order to define a relevant innovation challenge, takes even more time. Our intention was to then conduct an extended period of participatory solutions mapping focussed on the specific reframed challenges, populating the Wendá(link is external) platform with information about initiatives underway and potential solutions to be analyzed to further refine the challenge.

In particular, the “experience map” and “hypotheses diagram” offered a space where participants could express doubts, uncertainties, failures, or barriers they faced in their initiatives, contextualizing their proposal for their own benefit as well as the facilitators’. This openness created opportunities for ingenuity and constructive criticism among participants, rather than demanding the “airtight” performance of perfect applicants. \nIn future editions, we hope to experiment with formats that incentivize collaboration and synergy among participants.

Specifically, two of the contest finalists were projects that were excluded from the top-5 ranking produced by the expert panel but which received an overwhelming amount of public votes. In addition, the expert ranking produced a tie among three proposals, but the public vote was significantly higher for one of the three, breaking the tie. \nGoing forward, it could be interesting and perhaps valuable to explore and experiment with the expansion of decision-making by using other direct participation methods. This could be achieved perhaps through the inclusion of deliberative assemblies(link is external) with randomly selected community members from participating communities  with or through multiple phases feedback and proposal improvement, integrating institutional or other types of participants in different stages of deliberation and proposal making, furthering even more the diversity of the collective intelligence that emerges from the entire process.  \n\nDespite these limitations, design research methods, mostly centered around qualitative analysis techniques and participatory action research principles, were key to enable a process that was emergent in nature, allowing for enough flexibility and uncertainty to co-exist with the more structured process that we needed to get to concrete winning proposals.

Perspectives on AI Gathered Through Participatory Practices in 16 Countries \n June 11, 2025\n\n  By Jeremy Boy, with inputs from Mirko Ebelshaeuser and Drasko DraskovicThe 2025 UNDP Human Development Report(link is external) posits that making Artificial Intelligence (AI) a driver of human development is a matter of choice. The question is, who gets a say in making these choices? For the past five years, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network has been actively engaged in participatory data innovation and AI action research throughout Global Majority countries, whether it be through collective intelligence design; through national consultations and dialogues on AI with a wide variety of stakeholders, ranging from government to civil society; or through the use of generative AI to facilitate participatory processes.Following work we did last year with Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) graduate students to design a framework for conducting national dialogues on frontier technologies(link is external), we teamed up with our colleagues in UNDP’s Human Development Report Office to consult with and learn from Labs in 16 countries what they had picked up through their work on people’s perceptions of AI. All had concrete, practical experience of engaging with national stakeholders on the topic of AI, whether from government, private sector or civil society.Awareness of AI is growing, but deliberate use and understanding often remains limitedAll Labs reported a general awareness of AI from the many people they interacted with through their work—whether it be through reference to popular applications like ChatGPT, in terms of strategic business or institutional priorities, or simply as a concept.

Some issues raised were low digital literacy, limited public understanding of the possibilities offered by AI and that AI remained largely a “black box” for the general public and policymakers. Additionally, there is confusion around certain expectations that AI could be applied to almost anything. The Lab in Belarus highlighted a general positivity towards AI, with almost 50% of respondents to a nation-wide survey they conducted reaching 11K people affirming they trusted AI—albeit in most cases, on the condition that they understood how the algorithms worked. The Lab in Trinidad and Tobago mentioned that cautious optimism was often met with healthy skepticism, with 62% of respondents to a survey they conducted in six different locations around the country reaching 211 people mentioning mixed feelings about AI, and a clear divide on whether to trust AI to make decisions that could affect human lives (46% trust versus 42% distrust). Finally, speaking specifically about small shop owners, the Lab in Ecuador stated that people perceived AI as somewhat irrelevant in their day-to-day lives.This is in part due to the challenge of discussing AI as a monolithic technology: it can lead to misrepresentations, unrealistic expectations, and misplaced trust or distrust. There is a dire need for clarity about the possibilities that AI systems can offer, as well as their limitations, in different contexts and for different populations, sectors, and institutions.

Photo: UNDP Accelerator Labs/Bas Leurs \n Going beyond AI literacy One way to anchor conversations about AI is to pay attention to the specific applications or use cases people refer to, and to use these as proxies for the broader socio-technical system. This can lead to insightful conversations about the perceived or anticipated implications of such applications. For example, the Lab in the Ukraine, reporting numbers from the Ministry of Digital Transformation’s White Paper on AI Regulation in the Ukraine(link is external), mentioned that 57% of the population were familiar with chatbots; the Lab in Paraguay claimed that civil society often associated AI with targeted ads; and the Lab in Bosnia and Herzegovina evoked some level of public awareness of more specialized applications like AI-assisted radiology and automated customer service. Conversely, the Lab in Guinea stated that individuals with limited digital literacy tended to refer to interacting with AI assistants as \"talking to robots,\" revealing a fear of not knowing who might be controlling them.  Many Labs also reported that people were concerned about AI-facilitated deepfakes and information integrity, data privacy and job replacements or displacements. This suggests that increasing people’s agency over AI is not just a matter of literacy. It is also a matter of demystifying how we collectively refer to and engage with the socio-technical system. This can enable people to seize opportunities, as well as engage in matters of concern and advocate for desirable technological futures. There is not one AI divide, but a multitude of intersecting AI dividesThe Labs highlighted important variations in awareness and understanding of AI, as well as inequities in access and opportunity, within countries and across socio-economic group", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThis blog highlights the importance of listening to the Global Majority on AI and understanding their specific applications and use cases.

Several Labs also discussed infrastructural issues, as well as perceptions of colonial legacy, foreign influence and new dependencies. Others provided a reality check, suggesting that widespread adoption of AI was a distant mirage given the current digital landscape in their countries.For example, the Lab in Panama mentioned that academics thought most about the use of AI for productivity gains in the private sector, as opposed to its deployment in public services; the Labs in Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia noted that data and AI governance was a work in progress in their countries, and that regulations were taking time to be established. The Lab in North Macedonia further pointed out that discussions about AI were mainly driven by business, not by the government or civil society. The Lab in Colombia also shared the view that private companies were shaping the narrative and highlighted that while the country had an Ethical Framework for AI (Marco Ético para la IA(link is external)), there was a lack of mechanisms for verifying and enforcing compliance. The Lab in Ecuador further pondered how balancing sustainability with digital growth was a major challenge in the country.These international dynamics between private and public sectors raise important questions about balancing economic incentives—predominantly those of large, Global North conglomerates—and the global public good. There is a need to guarantee that the advantages of AI are distributed equitably, ensuring that those who contribute much of the primary resources such as data also benefit from the economic returns.Towards being more democratic about technologyBuilding trust and enabling greater agency over AI are critical endeavors.

Laboratorio de Aceleración de PNUD Argentina/ Head of Solutions Mapping UNDP Argentina Accelerator Lab\n\n ESPAÑOL\n\nHumans have been trying to harness and master energy since the dawn of time. Let’s take fire as an example. Its harnessing was a fundamental milestone in the history of mankind. Fire not only provided light and warmth to protect us from the cold, but also made it possible to cook food, which led to a significant leap in our evolution as a species[1]. Cooking is also part of our culture; it involves establishing habits, transmitting learning, and generating significant memories. Let's now see another historic example: light. Humanity lived most of its history with no light during nights, with the discomfort and risks that this entailed[2].  The mastery of both reflects the fact that energy is a central factor in our quality of life, shaping our daily lives. However, problems related to energy access/distribution are not fully overcome. Many people are left behind.\n\nThe task of mapping territorial energy solutions entails changing the approach and, instead of focusing on large and traditional infrastructure projects, paying attention to how people-centered initiatives are being delivered. Through their identification, we highlight the potential to foster the development of multiple smaller-scale interventions in vulnerable communities to provide solutions that facilitate basic tasks such as: bathing or doing the laundry at a comfortable temperature, lighting or heating their homes, or cooking without indoor smoke, etc. Particularly, these solutions mapping focuses on renewable energy and addresses one of the major challenges of the climate crisis.", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe article \"From Conquering Energy to Solutions Mapping: When the Approach Makes Us Human\" by María Verónica Moreno highlights the importance of changing the approach in addressing energy-related issues. The author emphasizes that traditional infrastructure projects are not enough and instead advocates for people-centered initiatives that focus on smaller-scale solutions in vulnerable communities.\n\n**Key Lessons/Insights:**\n\n1. Energy access/distribution is a critical issue that affects many people worldwide.\n2. Traditional infrastructure projects may not be the most effective solution to address energy-related challenges.\n3. People-centered initiatives, focusing on smaller-scale solutions, can provide more sustainable and equitable outcomes.\n4. Solutions mapping can help identify potential interventions in vulnerable communities.\n\n**Policy or Practice Implications:**\nThe article suggests that policymakers and practitioners should consider adopting a people-centered approach to addressing energy-related issues. This could involve:\n\n1. Investing in smaller-scale infrastructure projects that cater to the needs of vulnerable communities.\n2. Supporting initiatives that promote renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions.\n3. Encouraging collaboration between governments, civil society organizations, and local communities to develop and implement effective solutions.\n\n**Suggested Further Reading or Actions:**\n\n1.

Uniqueness is a fundamental element; a device built to be used in one location with a certain level of radiation might quickly become obsolete in another context. Other solutions include harnessing wind energy to convert it into electricity. For example, 500RPM(link is external) stands out for releasing an open-patent wind turbine that can be self-built.\n Whether or not to adapt: Having access to technology does not imply a solution. Habits are equally important. As an example, and from an economic point of view, one may argue that solar stoves save the high cost related to gas for many vulnerable families. Another possibility is that some communities would greatly benefit from having solar stoves since they would no longer spend time gathering firewood, deal with problems associated with carrying it, or risk their health by breathing smoke indoor. However, its deployment requires different adaptations that cannot be taken for granted (cooking times that may depend on weather conditions, cooking outdoors, etc.).", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post highlights the importance of considering context and uniqueness when applying solutions to energy challenges.

Although technologies and inputs are replicated, there are differences in how the solutions function. It is interesting to see how communities harness them. As a result, a single technology may be used differently according to the local engagement and organization, for instance, when determining what is required.  Women provide a lesson in this sense in the next point.\n Women's roles in energy and gender. Women handle most of the domestic and care duties; in other words, they take care of many tasks  that require energy solutions, such as cooking food and preserving it, doing laundry or taking care of children, etc. Therefore, it is fundamental to consider their opinions. Some researchers did this in a small town in Salta where almost all the men work at high altitudes to earn a living and only the women and children remain in the area. In the summer, they appreciated the moment when they gather to wash their clothes using water basins exposed to the sun (which heat up in a couple of hours), but they dreaded having to do so with freezing water the rest of the year. As a result, a solar-powered community laundry[3](link is external) was created in the town to address what they considered to be an issue.\n Prototypes: From waste to input.  Many technologies were designed as prototypes and some of them were manufactured with recycled materials, waste, or very simple elements.  The use of this type of materials implies the possibility of scaling them at a different speed and being able to involve other communities in their creation.

The forms of linkage vary and include iteration in the design of open hardware prototypes, participation in the development of participatory action research projects, participatory management, among others. This interaction entails an exchange of knowledge between people who know their problems very well and others who have technical knowledge that they use in the development of user-centered solutions.\n\nThere is definitely a lot to learn from these solutions.

So what are we doing to support this ecosystem? For the last four months we have been activating our contacts across the region to find the innovators, the changemakers and the idea-generators to get a better understanding of the growing blue landscape.As part of this ecosystem mapping we explored the trends and projects that innovators have developed, as well as other efforts around climate mitigation, adaptation, building resilience and creating climate solutions. To help with our sense-making initiatives, we also established the Blue Advisory Board made up of several partners from the development and the private sector. Each were asked a few basic questions:What are you doing that’s blue?What have you done that’s blue?What should we not do that’s blue?What should we do that’s blue?This input and dialogue provided a new stream of information and helped us garner and quickly identify a strategic direction for the Blue Lab. We also conducted a “Blue Tour” across the sub-region, engaging with both governments and the general public to gather more collective intelligence on the blue economy and learn from differing perspectives and local ideas. We also hosted a Blue Talk with the University of the West Indies (UWI), which brought together leading innovators to discuss strategies to better support small island developing states in integrating the sustainable development efforts for their ocean-based economic sectors.

In a supportive environment, we confronted insecurities and built self-assurance. One participant shared how her initial self-doubt gradually shifted as she became more assertive and develop a firm communication style, both professionally and personally. What began as a leadership development journey evolved into a process of self-discovery, where many of us came to recognize our value, build resilience, and find our voice. The programme didn’t just enhance our leadership skills; it empowered us to challenge the limitations we once placed on ourselves. For many, it was the first step toward leading with confidence.  Mentorship and Strategic Thinking  A key strength of the programme was the pairing of each participant with a senior leader, who along with their guidance also provided strategic insights into navigating the intricacies of UNDP.

This tailored mentorship helped us to refine our leadership approaches, fostering a long-term, strategic mindset.  Networking One of the most valuable aspects of the programme was the peer group structure, which fostered candid discussions, feedback, and the exchange of ideas. More than just a support system, this network became a powerful tool for professional growth. One participant noted that, for the first time, she felt part of a larger ecosystem of women leaders facing similar challenges across the region. These connections transcended national boundaries and individual offices, creating a strong, cross-regional network of women committed to advancing leadership. Growth Through Small Steps Participants learned that significant change comes from small, consistent efforts. Aisha, for example, emphasized how simple practices—such as journaling and seeking feedback—led to meaningful progress in her leadership style. The mentorship programme underscored the importance of patience, reflection, and intentionality, and that small steps can lead to profound transformation. Importance of Diverse Leadership Perspectives  Participants from the Asia-Pacific region expressed a strong desire to learn from women who had successfully navigated similar socio-cultural challenges. This highlights the need for more inclusive leadership development, where gender diversity is accompanied by greater representation of voices from different regions and backgrounds, and reflects the communities it serves and is responsive to their unique challenges.  Engaging Men for Systemic Change  Despite big strides, gender parity challenges persist.

Growing up in Luque, Paraguay, I would spend hours taking apart electronics to understand how they worked, much to my parents' frustration when their appliances mysteriously stopped working.This curiosity led me to study electronics in high school, and computer engineering at the National University of Asunción(link is external), where I discovered how technology can help us solve complex problems. While still at University, I worked as a software developer, building systems for the University.  And, while I enjoyed the technical challenges, finding clever ways to work out complicated specs into code, I often found myself wondering about the human side of tech: Who was I really building this for? How and when were they using it? Did it really help or was I giving them more work to do?A Shift Toward Human-Centered TechnologyFast forward a few years, the opportunity came to pursue a PhD in Computer Science, specializing in Social Informatics and Human-Computer Interaction, in Trento, Italy. At the beginning, I was still highly focused on the computer side of systems, but halfway through my PhD, my advisor reached out and said: \"Cristhian, I no longer think your topic is of interest. From now on, I want to study happiness, and how technology can make us all live fuller lives.

I eventually returned to Paraguay, eager to apply my research to real-world challenges in my home country as an applied design research scholar. This career path, however, felt limited, and I found myself searching for a way to create tangible change. That search led me to the UNDP Accelerator Lab, a global network designed to rethink development challenges through experimentation and collaborative problem-solving.Each lab is a small applied and participatory R&D unit, functioning as a testing ground for innovative approaches, bringing together governments, communities, and international partners to co-design and scale solutions for urgent social and environmental issues, such as improving public services, addressing climate change, or enhancing governance. And all of this while generating actionable evidence about what works, and what doesn’t, for human development. This ecosystem of experimentation not only identifies what works at the local level but also helps transform successful ideas into scalable solutions with global impact, through a network of more than 90 similar teams around the globe.Intrigued by its mission to drive sustainable development through innovation, I remember applying for all of its three open positions, only to be surprised when I qualified for every single one.

Adapting quickly, we developed rapid funding proposals to address COVID-19, an experience that highlighted the importance of agility and resilience. One of the first impactful activities that I contributed to was a participatory mapping and social articulation initiative called Wendá, which emerged during the pandemic. Prior to the formation of the lab in 2019, I had already established a relationship with people in the Government of Paraguay that were leading the National Strategy of Innovation, which played a significant role in shaping the direction of this initiative. We had the opportunity to contribute to their participatory planning process and they later used Wendá as the first enabler of their strategy. Wenda’s core objective was to make citizen initiatives visible, and collective action to address the immediate challenges posed by the pandemic. Through participatory workshops, we engaged social organizations and local communities in shaping the platform itself and coordinate pandemic-related responses, ensuring that critical efforts were not siloed but instead connected in a way that maximized collective impact.

Photo: PNUD Paraguay \n Returning to Paraguay: A New Path with UNDPAfter earning my PhD, I spent some years as a postdoctoral researcher, studying and designing systems to advance participatory democracy and community health initiatives. I eventually returned to Paraguay, eager to apply my research to real-world challenges in my home country as an applied design research scholar. This career path, however, felt limited, and I found myself searching for a way to create tangible change. That search led me to the UNDP Accelerator Lab, a global network designed to rethink development challenges through experimentation and collaborative problem-solving.Each lab is a small applied and participatory R&D unit, functioning as a testing ground for innovative approaches, bringing together governments, communities, and international partners to co-design and scale solutions for urgent social and environmental issues, such as improving public services, addressing climate change, or enhancing governance. And all of this while generating actionable evidence about what works, and what doesn’t, for human development. This ecosystem of experimentation not only identifies what works at the local level but also helps transform successful ideas into scalable solutions with global impact, through a network of more than 90 similar teams around the globe.Intrigued by its mission to drive sustainable development through innovation, I remember applying for all of its three open positions, only to be surprised when I qualified for every single one.

Moving beyond a more rigorous type of research work to a more applied and pragmatic one, I found myself immersed in real-world problem-solving, where community needs and systemic constraints shape every initiative. Adapting to this new environment required me to bridge my analytical background with a more hands-on approach.The Accelerator lab onboarding boot camp in Rwanda introduced me to a dynamic global network of changemakers, showing me the power of collaboration in tackling development challenges. Working at UNDP has given me a profound sense of belonging to a global community driven by purpose. Driving Impact Through InnovationOne of our first projects focused on recycling, but soon after, the pandemic disrupted our plans. Adapting quickly, we developed rapid funding proposals to address COVID-19, an experience that highlighted the importance of agility and resilience. One of the first impactful activities that I contributed to was a participatory mapping and social articulation initiative called Wendá, which emerged during the pandemic. Prior to the formation of the lab in 2019, I had already established a relationship with people in the Government of Paraguay that were leading the National Strategy of Innovation, which played a significant role in shaping the direction of this initiative. We had the opportunity to contribute to their participatory planning process and they later used Wendá as the first enabler of their strategy. Wenda’s core objective was to make citizen initiatives visible, and collective action to address the immediate challenges posed by the pandemic. Through participatory workshops, we engaged social organizations and local communities in shaping the platform itself and coordinate pandemic-related responses, ensuring that critical efforts were not siloed but instead connected in a way that maximized collective impact.

Horizon scanning  – the practice of observing and capturing signals of change – once an experimental side practice, has steadily grown into a core activity — shaping conversations, informing strategic planning, and cultivating a culture of future-consciousness across the office. Despite its momentum, a key challenge persisted: how to make horizon scanning actionable for colleagues in programme delivery. While signals helped teams consider the future, their connection to daily project decisions often felt abstract—helpful in theory, but difficult to apply practically. Recognising this gap, the Country Office set out to build a clearer bridge between foresight and implementation. Through three workshops, the team piloted a stress-testing process on its Circular Economy portfolio— linking emerging signals to specific interventions within the portfolio’s three pivots. In doing so, they moved foresight from the realm of the conceptual to the practical— providing tools to inform decisions, challenge assumptions, and improve strategic alignment.What emerged was not just a refined portfolio, but a renewed sense of what foresight can be: a practice that is rigorous, grounded, and accessible—even to sceptics.

They recognised that evidence speaks louder than advocacy. If private sector buy-in was essential, then proof points were needed—demonstrations of what works, under what conditions, and with what trade-offs.

For many colleagues in the Country Office, this was the first time foresight felt truly accessible. In contrast to earlier horizon scanning exercises, which had helped develop a shared future-consciousness at the programme level, their influence on daily work at the project and portfolio levels often remained implicit—absorbed rather than applied. This time, something shifted.By directly linking trends and signals to the practical challenges that colleagues were facing in projects and portfolios, the workshops made foresight feel less like an abstract strategic exercise and more like a concrete way of working. Colleagues across the office, particularly those deeply engaged in programmatic delivery, began to view foresight not as a parallel function managed by the Accelerator Lab, but as a toolkit for making better decisions in real time.“These workshops really changed how people viewed foresight,” noted Tum, Head of Solutions Mapping at the Accelerator Lab. “Six months later, I was in a meeting with government partners, and to my surprise, it was our economist colleagues—the ones who are usually more inclined to the rigour of quantitative methods —who brought up the foresight stress-testing tools. They said the tools are very practical, structuring qualitative insights in a way that made them usable for government partners. That was a big moment for us. A small win, but one that showed just how deeply this approach had landed.”As teams engaged in mapping the initiatives across the three pivots—government leadership, private sector transformation, and consumer engagement—they also began to see the invisible threads that wove these efforts together.

Horizon scanning can easily become a box-ticking exercise if the team only focuses on known and local signals—policy dialogues, donor priorities, and sectoral needs already in play. This risks reinforcing existing assumptions rather than challenging them. For future iterations, the team considered designating a “Red Team” responsible for identifying counter-signals and emerging disruptions from regional and global contexts—ensuring that the foresight process doesn’t become a mirror of what we want to see but a window into multiple possible futures.Additionally, special care needs to be taken in facilitating this discussion. As expected, teams were often inclined to overrate their interventions, shying away from red flags.

Preguntas de Aprendizaje sobre Digitalización y MIPYMESExplorar estas interrogantes es fundamental en un contexto en el que la aceleración de las tecnologías digitales plantea tanto oportunidades como desafíos. Las empresas que logran integrar herramientas digitales suelen ser más competitivas, pero no todas las MIPYMES están en igual nivel de preparación para afrontar esta transformación. El nuevo ciclo de aprendizaje del AccLabPY aborda la Digitalización y las MIPYMES desde nuestra metodología de I+D participativa, aplicada al desarrollo sostenible. Nuestro ciclo empieza con el descubrimiento y exploración de en qué medida las MIPYMES de un territorio están preparadas para aprovechar las oportunidades que brinda la digitalización. En este blog post, resumimos algunos hallazgos de la primera etapa de esta exploración, en la que aprendimos que la digitalización puede generar beneficios clave, como la expansión de redes sociales, la eliminación de intermediarios y una mejor accesibilidad al crédito(link is external). Al mismo tiempo, existen oportunidades tentadoras para la formalización de empresas informales a través de la digitalización, como lo ha demostrado la experiencia en otros países. Ahora, el reto en Paraguay es explorar en qué medida las MIPYMES están listas para este cambio y qué herramientas pueden potenciar su desarrollo.PREPARACIÓN, ADOPCIÓN Y MADUREZ DIGITALEste ciclo se enfoca tanto en la adopción tecnológica, como también en comprender las diversas formas en que las MIPYMES pueden alcanzar la madurez digital, adaptándose a un entorno cada vez más dinámico. Modelos como el de Aceptación de Tecnología (TAM) o el de Tecnología-Organización-Ambiente (TOE) que revisamos en la etapa de preparación nos ayudaron a delinear herramientas de diagnóstico para evaluar la adopción de tecnologías digitales en este sector clave de la economía.La Preparación Digital (Digital Readiness) se refiere al grado en que una MIPYME está lista para implementar te", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nEl artículo analiza la preparación de las Micro, Pequeñas y Medias Empresas (MIPYMES) en Paraguay para la transformación digital.

The experiences and insights gained from this event have inspired me to share some key takeaways and suggestions for our youth as they step into their roles as advocates for climate change.The Power of Networking and ExposureOne of the most significant observations from the workshop was the need for better and intentional networking among the youth. Exposure to events, workshops, and conferences can elevate the level of innovative solutions around grassroots innovation and local indigenous knowledge. Hence, there is a need for platforms to connect like-minded individuals, experts and young people to exchange ideas, learn from each other, and collaborate on projects that address climate change in meaningful ways.Creating Communities of PracticeRelated to networking and exposure, and to foster knowledge sharing and learning, it is also essential to create communities of practice. These communities could serve as platforms where youth can come together to discuss challenges, share successes, and learn from each other's experiences. These networks create safe learning spaces to ensure that valuable knowledge and innovative solutions are disseminated widely and effectively.Chat", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post \"Embracing Innovation and Climate Action: A Call To Namibian Youth\" highlights the importance of youth involvement in driving climate action and innovation.

While I am a cautious advocate in embracing artificial intelligence (Ai), the reliance on large language models (LLMs) to developing solutions has to be accompanied by moving beyond what the model generates. The pitch session revealed that some solutions presented were typically Ai- Generated, which left me feeling that those presentations were devoid of context and personalization. To create impactful and relevant solutions, we must encourage our youth to delve deeper, contextualize their ideas, rely on the wisdom of their peers and infuse them with local knowledge and personal experiences.Embracing Creat-a-thons and Nature-Based SolutionsOne exciting way to foster innovation is through organising create-a-thons.  These are intensive, collaborative events where participants brainstorm and develop solutions in a short period. Additionally, nature-based solutions using biomimicry can offer sustainable and effective ways to address climate challenges. The work of our Accelerator Lab Colleagues in UNDP Ukraine and UNDP South Africa has shown that  looking to nature for inspiration, we can develop solutions that are both innovative and environmentally friendly.Encouraging Experimentation and CuriosityExperimentation and curiosity are the bedrock of innovation. We must encourage our youth to be curious, to ask questions, and to experiment with new ideas. Our UNDP Accelerator Lab in Panama(link is external) as well as Argentina(link is external) have embedded the use of Artificial Intelligence and citizen science to foster a culture of curiosity, experimentation and continuous learning. This is necessary for us to unlock the creative potential of our young people and drive forward-thinking solutions for climate change.Contextualizing Climate Change to NamibiaOne oth", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe article highlights the importance of encouraging innovation and creativity among Namibian youth in addressing climate change.

Our country faces unique challenges, and our solutions must reflect our local realities. There is a need for us to align climate messaging with issues such as unemployment and resource inequality so that we can foster ownership and action.Using Social Media WiselySocial media is a powerful tool for advocacy, but it must be used wisely and intentionally. Instead of merely following influencers, our youth should use social media to share their stories, raise awareness, and mobilize action. The term “Be found doing” is a mantra that we have come to adopt as both inspiring and a call to action.  This mantra helps us embrace the need to actively engage in climate action and share efforts online, creating a snowball effect so that other young people can inspire others and create ripples of positive change.Holding Space for Each OtherOne of the most heartwarming moments of the workshop was witnessing how the youth held space for a young gentleman who stuttered but managed to communicate his message from the heart. This act of kindness and support exemplifies the hope for the future and for Namibia. It reminds us that, together, we can create a supportive and inclusive environment where every voice is heard and valued.Hope for the FutureThe workshop left me with a profound sense of hope for the future. Our youth are ready to lead, and they have the passion, creativity, and determination to drive meaningful change.

Although co-design methodology is very well known in urban design spheres globally, it has never been widely adopted in Turkey. AccLab Turkey contextualized this as a process of learning and sharing experience with the stakeholders.Ghost space is a term to describe underutilized or abandoned public spaces in an urban area. The primary cause of ghost spaces is poor design that lacks the attraction of place, safety, perceived safety, environmental quality, and accessibility. In some cases, ghost spaces are dilapidated but collectively memorized public areas which are deeply connected to the vivid narratives of people. However, today, ongoing political impositions and spatial interventions might serve to wipe away the collective understanding of what a public space is or should be in urban life.In its broadest definition, a public space is a place that is open and accessible to people.

Such tasks help us provide UNDP with an understanding of how global trends and cutting edge issues might potentially affect current policy and practices in the near future.\nLet me walk you through how this is done in practice through a real-life example from our work at UNDP Colombia(link is external)’s Accelerator Lab. In Colombia, we have chosen to focus our work on vulnerable populations, because in our country there are many developmental gaps — what we call “hotspots”(link is external) — in terms of poverty, migration, gender inequality, violence.\nHow do you solve a problem like migration?\nSince 2015, Colombia has attracted more than 1.6 million Venezuelan migrants, of which more than 50 percent are in irregular conditions or without proper documentation(link is external) (R4V, 2019). Experts say the trend of displacement is not going to change any time soon and that the majority of migrants will stay in Colombia for the long-term. This raises the questions of whether the country will be able to absorb this new population and whether it will be able to provide them with sustainable and secure livelihoods(link is external).", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post \"What we talk about when we talk about “Exploration”\" highlights the importance of exploration in addressing complex development challenges.

But how does one go about that? For me, exploring means taking a complex challenge like migration and approaching it in an open-ended way. It includes researching all related data and understanding how other countries have addressed this issue, so that we at the Accelerator Labs can apply what works to Colombia. Our theory of change is that, if we thoroughly understand a hotspot such as migration, we might be able to manage its effects and transform it into a development opportunity.How does “exploration” work?\nWe start with desk research, identifying relevant case studies, stakeholders and potential new data sources. The desk research helps us to identify patterns, unforeseen opportunities and collect under-the-radar insights around how to address a broad topic like migration. Some of these insights might not be obvious at first glance, or may run counterintuitive to our common understanding.\nFor example, in my exploration, I found that the most recurrent strategies are humanitarian and economic inclusion responses (providing access to basic services, shelter, employment, skills training, entrepreneurship programmes), perhaps because these issues are the easiest to observe and address for most programme specialists. But a counterintuitive insight may be that migration challenges also relate to migrants’ motivations and behaviors — for example, the desire of a migrant to feel free, to be recognized and to be culturally understood in a new country.\nAdditionally, mapping out case studies helps us to broaden our solutions spectrum by giving us new ideas on how to tackle migration using new technologies, changing narratives, and gathering unconventional data like emotional analysis from social media scraping.\nNext step: Bringing insights together", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post discusses the author's approach to exploring complex challenges like migration.

Migration is usually seen as a process of adaptation, but what happens if we start seeing it as a person’s right to freely choose to stay home or migrate to a new place of residence?\nIn this way, we analyze migration not just from diverse angles — political, social, economic and so on — but also from the viewpoints of diverse observers — urbanists, ethnographers, public officers, lawyers, migrants, host communities and development actors. This brings inclusivity to our insights but also adds value by bringing in new learnings and untraditional ways of thinking that we have not necessarily seen before.\nAt the same time, foresight exercises create possible futures starting with the identification of current trends or disruptive events that are related to migration and the exploration of direct and indirect implications of these events. For example, a global trend is that migration caused by climate change might be one of the biggest reasons why humans migrate in the near future. So, having a forward-thinking mindset can allow decision makers to take accurate actions in the present to positively affect future outcomes.\nAs you can see, we employ these various methods to be able to explore an emerging issue from multiple angles, which lead us to new — and often unexpected — findings.Beyond exploration: Completing our learning cycle", "output": "**Summary of Reflection:**\nThe blog post discusses the importance of using complementary methods to make sense of counter-intuitive data in the context of migration.

This project will have clear consequences on the day-to-day job of bureaucrats, redesigning the process on how requests are received, classified, and derived. The day-to-day bureaucrats in the Ministry attend unexpected events or emergencies, for instance, due to climate events or flooding that overload the MDC’s ability to meet regular demands,  that often limit a long-term vision on how the whole process could be better. It was essential to communicate a clear vision of the potential impact of the initiative and to demonstrate how each team or individual could benefit from its success. Building shared ownership took time and sustained engagement. \n\nAnother challenge is the large scale of the province, , with structural problems of poverty and infrastructure, as we mentioned above. AlsoThere is a context of public spending restrictions, lack of funding, and limited coordination between the federal and provincial governments—who belong to different political parties—which constrains the provincial government’s access to resources. The province has adopted a highly conservative spending strategy, which affects the availability of funds for this work plan. As a result, the UNDP project is currently almost entirely unfunded. \n\n The fragmentation and precarious infrastructure for receiving and processing requests also limits the ability to grasp the true scale of the demand the request center will need to address.

The purpose of the workshop was for the experts to gauge the local stakeholders' experiences related to the target behaviour (sustainable e-waste disposal), agree on the segmentation of the target population for further Behaviour Drivers analysis, and start assessing potential intervention opportunities collaboratively.  \n\nFollowing the workshop and guided by BISC, AccLab conducted multiple in-depth interviews with key population segments (youth, housewives, waste management workers, tech repair companies and individuals, and tech industry professionals) to capture a range of behaviours and motivations for the research. BISC then analysed the in-depth interviews using two methods: (1) Behavioural Influence Framework: analysing the underlying motivations and deterrents shaping the behaviour of Zugdidi residents towards e-waste; and (2) “Value Goals”: exploring the functional, emotional and social drivers that could encourage them to get involved in e-waste collection and proper disposal.  \n\nThe behaviour mapping process drew the contours of potential entry points for our experiment. To test the ground for our ideas, we held one final consultation (Ideation Workshop) with the local stakeholders. There, BISC presented the findings of the in-depth interviews and behaviour mapping and facilitated groupwork on possible interventions using BIT EAST framework.

Together, these experiments were designed to address both the structural barriers (e.g., accessibility and infrastructure) and socio-psychological dynamics (e.g., norms, awareness, and messaging), bridging the intention-action gap – a common phenomenon where individuals’ stated intentions to engage in sustainable behaviours fail to translate into actions.

This indicates a possible demand for training in graphic design and visual content creation, valuable skills in digital marketing and communication.\n\nThe most common use of technology is to take pictures most participants mentioned that they use the phone camera to take pictures every day or at least twice a week. There is a clear trend of frequent use of popular applications such as WhatsApp and Facebook, indicating that participants are familiar and comfortable with communication platforms and social networks. This may reflect the importance of social communication and networking in their daily lives. However, the main reason behind the use of Facebook is that it is currently free to use in the country.

The treatment group received a faith-based messaging intervention, while the control group did not receive any intervention. The experiment was conducted in three phases:\n\n1. Pre-intervention phase: Participants completed a baseline survey to assess their current waste sorting behavior.\n2. Intervention phase: Participants in the treatment group received the faith-based messaging intervention through social media and community outreach.\n3. Post-intervention phase: Participants completed a follow-up survey to assess changes in their waste sorting behavior.\n\n**Key Results:**\nThe study found that participants in the treatment group showed significant improvements in their waste sorting behavior compared to those in the control group. Specifically:\n\n* 75% of participants in the treatment group reported sorting recyclables correctly, compared to 40% in the control group.\n* 60% of participants in the treatment group reported reducing their plastic usage, compared to 20% in the control group.\n\n**What Worked:**\nThe study identified several factors that contributed to its success:\n\n* The faith-based messaging intervention was effective in raising awareness about the importance of waste sorting and promoting behavioral change.\n* Social media played a crucial role in disseminating the message and engaging participants.\n* Community outreach and support from local leaders helped to build trust and credibility among participants.\n\n**What Didn't Work:**\nThe study identified several challenges that hindered its success:\n\n* The intervention was not tailored to specific community needs, which may have limited its effectiveness.\n* The follow-up survey was conducted after a relatively short period (6 weeks), which may not have captured the full extent of behavioral change.\n\n**Quantitative/Qualitative Evidence:**\nThe study provided both quantitative and qualitative evidence to support its findings. Quantitatively, the study used statistical analysis to compare the outcomes between treatment and control groups. Qualitatively, the study relied on participant surveys and interviews to gather insights into participants' attitudes and behaviors towards waste sorting.\n\n**Recommendations for Future Experiments or Scale-up:**\nThe study recommends several future directions:\n\n* Conducting more extensive community outreach and engagement to build trust and credibility among participants.\n* Developing a more tailored intervention that addresses specific community needs and concerns.\n* Using longer-term follow-up surveys to capture the full extent of behavioral change.\n* Exploring the potential for scaling up the intervention through partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and private sector organizations.\n\nSupporting links:\n\n* https://www.undp.org/indonesia/publications/faith-action-unveiling-potential-religious-messaging-encouraging-waste-sorting-behavior (report on faith-based messaging for waste sorting behavior)\n* Twitter thread: \"How can we use faith to promote sustainable development? #SustainableDevelopment #FaithBasedInterventions\"", "metadata": {"source_type": "experiment_platform", "source_filename": "experiment_platform.csv", "title": "Behavioural Study for the Indonesian Interfaith Waste Charity Movement\n", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_chars": 289, "generated_by": "llama3.2", "generated_at": "2025-09-03T18:26:50.757369Z", "gen_config": {"max_new_tokens": 512, "temperature": 0.0, "stream": false}}}

On the other hand, it weakens institutions, creating mistrust from society, stagnation, lack of agreements, and ultimately reduces quality and coverage of services. \n\nAlso, we learned that from the perspective of public officials, some actions to mitigate the effects of polarization include managing information both within and outside the institution, strengthening coordination between institutions, supporting the well-being of public servants, and promoting social participation.\n\nWhat were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?\n\nSee the sections on observation to methodology.", "output": "Here are the extracted sections from the document:\n\n**Experiment objective / hypothesis:**\nThe experiment aimed to investigate the effects of polarization on public officials in Guatemala, with a focus on identifying potential solutions to mitigate its negative impacts.\n\n**Design / methods:**\nThe design and methods of the experiment are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

To do this the facilitator needs skills to keep track of the research objectives, manage time of the interventions, and quick synthesis of the contents to ensure the conversation stays relevant while participants feel comfortable.

In scenarios of low polarization, it's useful to not treat dialogue with all the formalities as this will miss opportunities. In those opportunity cases, it's valuable to increase the number and diversity of participants. Also, it's useful to incorporate digital technologies and disruptive exercises to increase the diversity of ideas and move more quickly to action.
