The goal was to detect key inefficiencies such as fragmentation, overlapping functions, and outdated procedures, and to assess whether the proposed One-Stop Shop model could enhance access, optimize the use of resources, and better serve those most in need.

In addition, we wanted to test if the lack of standardization in internal procedures generates inefficiency and inequity in the handling of requests and if weak coordination between municipal departments and with external actors (NGOs, national agencies, etc.) limits the comprehensive resolution of cases.    \n\nWhile this study is exploratory in nature and does not seek to establish statistical causality, it is guided by a set of working hypotheses.

This was complemented by a stakeholder mapping exercise that identified internal and external actors involved in the reception and processing of citizen requests. \n\nWe also conducted an activity mapping of the current service flows and documented how requests were received, categorized, and followed up across different departments. To contextualize the MDC experience, we conducted a literature review and a survey of similar experiences in public service redesign, drawing insights from cases such as the AUH, the CUIDAR app, and the Chatbot Bonaerense. \n\nTo deepen our understanding, we carried out in-depth semi-structured interviews with over a dozen key informants across all units involved in receiving and managing citizen requests. This helped us uncover operational inconsistencies, communication bottlenecks, and resource disparities. Lastly, we used service design mapping techniques to visualize pain points in the user journey—both for citizens and internal staff—and identify opportunities for systemic improvements. \n\nAll these actions took place within the Ministry and in coordination with its teams between September and December 2024. The insights generated are guiding the next phase of a more structured diagnostic and co-creation process for a unified and accessible citizen request center. \n\n "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:""}, {""id"": ""b175e457-b70b-419e-9224-9adc45971904"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""checklist"", ""level"": ""media"", ""options"": [{""id"": 0, ""name"": ""Civil Society"", ""checked"": false}, {""id"": 1, ""name"": ""Academia"", ""checked"": false}, {""id"": 2, ""name"": ""Private Sector"", ""checked"": false}, {""id"": 3, ""name"": ""Government (&amp; related)"", ""checked"": true}, {""id"": 4, ""name"": ""United Nations"", ""checked"": false}], ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)""}, {""id"": ""299fd5fe-5341-4fb1-b77c-426543f6c538"", ""name"": ""total_cost"", ""type"": ""radiolist"", ""level"": ""meta"", ""options"": [{""id"": 0, ""name"": ""Less than 1,000 USD"", ""checked"": false}, {""id"": 1, ""name"": ""Between 1,000 and 9,999 USD"", ""checked"": false}, {""id"": 2, ""name"": ""Between 10,000- and 20,000 USD"", ""checked"": false}, {""id"": 3, ""name"": ""More than 20,000 USD"", ""checked"": false}], ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": ""What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?""}, {""id"": ""39fe3cc3-8332-4651-9eb8-88991640524e"", ""src"": null, ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""scale"": ""original"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""center"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": ""Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.""}, {""id"": ""cce1964d-3f39-4446-b509-c095fdc6c2c9"", ""src"": null, ""html"": """", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""left"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": ""Please upload any supporting links""}], ""title"": ""Design"", ""structure"": [{""id"": ""cf2a3b9a-e7fa-4811-af30-355ce2d59dd8"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": true, ""is_excerpt"": true, ""instruction"": ""What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Based on a sensing or understanding exercise conducted jointly by the ministry and UNDP teams, along with interviews with key stakeholders and process analysis, the main findings included: \n\n- Multiplicity of intake channels: Currently, three main areas (Modernization, Carla Zocco’s team, and the Minister’s pre-private office) manage requests independently, without coordination or integrated systems. As a result, the intake and processing of requests are fragmented, often leading to duplication of tasks and of the same requests. \n\n- Outdated tools: Requests are recorded in various shared Excel spreadsheets, limiting the ability to track cases, causing duplication, and hindering access to consolidated information. There is also no unified database among the different areas, which impairs more strategic and evidence-based decision-making. \n\n- Lack of protocols: There are no standardized procedures for referral, categorization, follow-up, and case closure, which at times relies on the individual judgment of team members. This leads to a lack of long-term planning within the areas. \n\n- Reliance on informal tools: WhatsApp and personal email accounts are the main channels for internal and external communication. This limits knowledge and analysis regarding the number and processing of requests, and also poses risks to data security and traceability of citizens’ information. \n\n- Staff shortages and operational overload: The volume of requests exceeds the processing capacity of the current teams, who face insufficient technological resources — often using personal computers — and limited human resources. \n\n "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

This project will have clear consequences on the day-to-day job of bureaucrats, redesigning the process on how requests are received, classified, and derived. The day-to-day bureaucrats in the Ministry attend unexpected events or emergencies, for instance, due to climate events or flooding that overload the MDC’s ability to meet regular demands,  that often limit a long-term vision on how the whole process could be better. It was essential to communicate a clear vision of the potential impact of the initiative and to demonstrate how each team or individual could benefit from its success. Building shared ownership took time and sustained engagement. \n\nAnother challenge is the large scale of the province, , with structural problems of poverty and infrastructure, as we mentioned above. AlsoThere is a context of public spending restrictions, lack of funding, and limited coordination between the federal and provincial governments—who belong to different political parties—which constrains the provincial government’s access to resources. The province has adopted a highly conservative spending strategy, which affects the availability of funds for this work plan. As a result, the UNDP project is currently almost entirely unfunded. \n\n The fragmentation and precarious infrastructure for receiving and processing requests also limits the ability to grasp the true scale of the demand the request center will need to address. In this sense, there is no baseline from which to evaluate the impact of future reforms. \n\nLastly, the activity involved engaging with several new concepts and methodologies that were unfamiliar to our team, like concepts regarding service design and software. This required additional effort to learn, adapt, and sometimes rethink our initial assumptions. Interviews with key informants, like members of the data center of the University of Buenos Aires, other software engineers and people in the service industry were crucial to provide us with answers. \n\n "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
The accelerator lab and the inclusive growth CO cluster of UNDP Argentina are supporting the Ministry of Community Development of Buenos Aires province to to design and implement a centralized hub for receiving, processing, and monitoring citizen . The ministry is the largest of the province, and the province it self is the most populous in the country, accounting for approximately 38% of the national population. Moreover, 58.2% of its residents live in poverty, and 8.4% are unemployed. These figures reflect the complex social and economic situation facing the country, with Buenos Aires Province experiencing some of the most critical indicators of poverty, extreme poverty, and unemployment.

The specific learning from this activity is to understand how citizens currently interact with the Ministry’s services, and to identify how the current request-handling system operates: who manages it, with what resources and criteria requests are received, processed, and followed up. The goal was to detect key inefficiencies such as fragmentation, overlapping functions, and outdated procedures, and to assess whether the proposed One-Stop Shop model could enhance access, optimize the use of resources, and better serve those most in need. This process entailed a clear problem definition, ecosystem mapping, and narrowing the scope for targeted action.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
This study was exploratory in nature. Therefore, it sought to understand which factors hinder or facilitate the reception of requests. The main hypothesis planned to be tested was that processes for receiving applications affect their registration and monitoring and consequently limit the Ministry's ability to evaluate the outcomes of the policies designed to address the identified problems. In addition, we wanted to test if the lack of standardization in internal procedures generates inefficiency and inequity in the handling of requests and if weak coordination between municipal departments and with external actors (NGOs, national agencies, etc.) limits the comprehensive resolution of cases.    

While this study is exploratory in nature and does not seek to establish statistical causality, it is guided by a set of working hypotheses. These hypotheses serve as an analytical framework throughout the report, helping to organize findings, highlight key areas of concern, and inform the direction of proposed actions 

- The absence of standardized processes for receiving requests may lead to inconsistencies in how they are registered and monitored, weakening the Ministry’s ability to track and respond effectively. 

- Poor coordination between Ministry departments and with external actors can result in fragmented case management, delays, and incomplete solutions for citizens’ needs. 

- Differences in the availability of human and technological resources across departments may create inequities in the speed and quality of service provided to citizens. 

- When staff use varying criteria to refer requests, this can generate inefficiencies and inconsistent outcomes across different areas of the Ministry. 

- Without a single, clear, and accessible system for submitting requests, citizens—particularly those from vulnerable groups—may struggle to access services or receive timely responses.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
To test our working hypotheses, we carried out a series of coordinated actions between September and December 2024, in collaboration with the Ministry of Community Development of the Province of Buenos Aires and UNDP Argentina. 

First, we implemented a sensing plan, which involved weekly meetings with key Ministry and UNDP staff to gradually align problem definitions, objectives, and action strategies. This was complemented by a stakeholder mapping exercise that identified internal and external actors involved in the reception and processing of citizen requests. 

We also conducted an activity mapping of the current service flows and documented how requests were received, categorized, and followed up across different departments. To contextualize the MDC experience, we conducted a literature review and a survey of similar experiences in public service redesign, drawing insights from cases such as the AUH, the CUIDAR app, and the Chatbot Bonaerense. 

To deepen our understanding, we carried out in-depth semi-structured interviews with over a dozen key informants across all units involved in receiving and managing citizen requests. This helped us uncover operational inconsistencies, communication bottlenecks, and resource disparities. Lastly, we used service design mapping techniques to visualize pain points in the user journey—both for citizens and internal staff—and identify opportunities for systemic improvements. 

All these actions took place within the Ministry and in coordination with its teams between September and December 2024. The insights generated are guiding the next phase of a more structured diagnostic and co-creation process for a unified and accessible citizen request center.

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The hypotheses were supported by observational, no experimental, data. Based on a sensing or understanding exercise conducted jointly by the ministry and UNDP teams, along with interviews with key stakeholders and process analysis, the main findings included: 

- Multiplicity of intake channels: Currently, three main areas (Modernization, Carla Zocco’s team, and the Minister’s pre-private office) manage requests independently, without coordination or integrated systems. As a result, the intake and processing of requests are fragmented, often leading to duplication of tasks and of the same requests. 

- Outdated tools: Requests are recorded in various shared Excel spreadsheets, limiting the ability to track cases, causing duplication, and hindering access to consolidated information. There is also no unified database among the different areas, which impairs more strategic and evidence-based decision-making. 

- Lack of protocols: There are no standardized procedures for referral, categorization, follow-up, and case closure, which at times relies on the individual judgment of team members. This leads to a lack of long-term planning within the areas. 

- Reliance on informal tools: WhatsApp and personal email accounts are the main channels for internal and external communication. This limits knowledge and analysis regarding the number and processing of requests, and also poses risks to data security and traceability of citizens’ information. 

- Staff shortages and operational overload: The volume of requests exceeds the processing capacity of the current teams, who face insufficient technological resources — often using personal computers — and limited human resources.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
The most important learning outcomes of the experiment include a clearer understanding of the institutional ecosystem, the identification of internal organizational gaps, and the need for coordinated and user-centered solutions. The initial diagnostic revealed the importance of drawing from relevant experiences in other jurisdictions, recognizing internal resources and challenges, and engaging a broader range of stakeholders in the design of an effective request center. 

Based on these insights, changes are recommended: 

- Expand interviews with key informants to gather lessons from similar initiatives in other provinces or municipalities, which will help anticipate implementation challenges. 

- Conduct an internal assessment to map available resources, existing competencies, and potential overlaps, thereby improving coordination across teams. 

- Establish a task force working group composed of technical profiles from relevant MDC departments and supported by UNDP, to lead and validate proposals. 

- Form a technical team to develop and adapt systems that can efficiently manage internal and external requests in a coordinated way. 

- Deepen co-creation efforts with both internal stakeholders and citizens through interviews, workshops, consultations, and testing, ensuring that solutions are tailored to user needs. 

- Invest in strategic digital skills training for staff, enabling a cultural shift that supports inclusive and sustainable innovation. 

- Develop a strong project identity and narrative, supported by design and communication strategies, to motivate engagement and align internal and external incentives.

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?
Another significant obstacle was aligning the incentives of all stakeholders involved in the project. This project will have clear consequences on the day-to-day job of bureaucrats, redesigning the process on how requests are received, classified, and derived. The day-to-day bureaucrats in the Ministry attend unexpected events or emergencies, for instance, due to climate events or flooding that overload the MDC’s ability to meet regular demands,  that often limit a long-term vision on how the whole process could be better. It was essential to communicate a clear vision of the potential impact of the initiative and to demonstrate how each team or individual could benefit from its success. Building shared ownership took time and sustained engagement. 

Another challenge is the large scale of the province, , with structural problems of poverty and infrastructure, as we mentioned above. AlsoThere is a context of public spending restrictions, lack of funding, and limited coordination between the federal and provincial governments—who belong to different political parties—which constrains the provincial government’s access to resources. The province has adopted a highly conservative spending strategy, which affects the availability of funds for this work plan. As a result, the UNDP project is currently almost entirely unfunded. 

 The fragmentation and precarious infrastructure for receiving and processing requests also limits the ability to grasp the true scale of the demand the request center will need to address. In this sense, there is no baseline from which to evaluate the impact of future reforms. 

Lastly, the activity involved engaging with several new concepts and methodologies that were unfamiliar to our team, like concepts regarding service design and software. This required additional effort to learn, adapt, and sometimes rethink our initial assumptions. Interviews with key informants, like members of the data center of the University of Buenos Aires, other software engineers and people in the service industry were crucial to provide us with answers."

Excellent. The written expression used is eloquent, clear, and succinct. You enjoyed learning about the experiment and were able to understand it without difficulty.



Excellent. The learning intent is clearly stated through a meaningful hypothesis. You were able to easily understand the expected effect of an action, and the value of learning if such effect occurs.




Excellent. The experiment clearly presents evidence and uses it correctly. You were able to easily understand how observations are used to test the hypothesis, and conclusions recognize the level of uncertainty.



Excellent. The experiment shows extraordinary novelty and insight. You were impressed by the ingenuity for solving a challenge in a new way and the thoughtfulness of insights provided.



No particular risk. No ethical, sensitivity, reputational or other risks were identified.



Excellent. The tags used are very useful. You consider the tags are relevant, accurate, and at the right level of detail. They allow to link the experiment with related work.

These devices are high-cost, yet residents often lack the technical means and financial resources for proper maintenance. The experiment will assess strategies to promote the use of solar energy among indigenous migrant populations living in the metropolitan area of the city. \n\nThis study revealed that only 9% of surveyed households used the solar water heater as their sole source of hot water, while 45% used it in combination with other devices, and the remaining households did not use it at all. \n\nInterestingly, those who used the solar water heater rated it positively. Meanwhile, those who did not use it cited reasons such as a lack of information about its operation, unawareness of simple user-managed solutions, a lack of interaction with neighbors who had positive experiences, installation difficulties, or minor adjustments that could have been resolved with proper technical support. In sum, the survey demonstrated that a well-functioning technology is often disregarded when it is not properly installed or when users lack sufficient information about its use. \n\nThe findings highlighted that training, the positive influence of other users, and technical support are key factors in optimizing the use of solar water heaters and ensuring their full integration into the daily lives of beneficiary families. All identified problems had relatively simple and low-cost solutions, suggesting that an experiment could help determine the impact of these solutions on the adoption and usage of the devices. \n\nBuilding on these insights, the proposed experiment seeks to measure the impact of specific informational interventions on the perception and use of solar water heaters. \n\nA \""shock of information\"" will be implemented in two formats: one providing objective technical information and the other leveraging social norms, using testimonials from neighbors who have successfully optimized their use of these devices. \n\nThis experiment will assess changes in users' opinions about solar water heaters and in the willingness of non-users to adopt them before and after the intervention. It will identify effective strategies to enhance the adoption and optimization of solar energy use. The results will serve as inputs for future communication campaigns, strategies, and solutions aimed at expanding access to renewable energy solutions by promoting the adoption of solar water heaters and optimizing their use for current users. \n\nGiven the high cost of the already installed equipment and the difficulty of accessing new technologies in the region, this experiment is essential to ensuring the energy sustainability of families (https://www.undp.org/es/argentina/publicaciones/spotlight-renewable-energy-solutions-mapping-argentina) who already have these devices on their rooftops.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity?
The specific learning from this activity is to understand what factors favor and/or hinder the adoption of solar water heaters in low-income neighborhoods of Jujuy.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
This study was exploratory in nature. Therefore, it sought to understand which factors hinder or facilitate the adoption of solar water heaters in Jujuy. From there, in a second experimental phase, five hypotheses are planned to be tested: 

There is a positive relationship between receiving information about the technical aspects and maintenance of the solar water heater and the evaluation of the device. 

There is a positive relationship between receiving information about the economic benefits (savings) of the solar water heater and the evaluation of the device. 

There is a positive relationship between receiving information regarding the technical aspects and maintenance of the solar water heater and the intention to use the device. 

There is a positive relationship between receiving information about the economic benefits (savings) of the solar water heater and the intention to use the device. 

There is a positive (and stronger) relationship between receiving information based on neighbors' experiences concerning the technical aspects and maintenance of the solar water heater and the intention to use the device, compared to receiving the same information without involving the neighbors

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?
In the exploratory phase 129 households were surveyed, where only 9 used the solar water heater exclusively, 45 used it alongside other devices, and 75 did not use it. In many households that had water heaters but chose not to use them, installation issues, technical difficulties, and a lack of training and support were reported. Simple and low-complexity technical problems that had gone undetected were identified, including the improper installation of the device on the roof. This situation also applies to more costly but similarly low-complexity problems, such as construction deficiencies in the homes. The lack of follow-up and proper training has been a significant obstacle to the effective adoption of this technology. The absence of a critical mass of users further compounded the lack of support. As a result, non-users had no access to peer-provided information about shared experiences or potential solutions, nor did they have neighbors who could guide them through the learning curve of using the devices.

Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?
The methodology for the Jujuy solar water heater project provides valuable insights through a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative interviews and focus groups with survey data. However, the small sample of exclusive users and the reliance on self-reported data limit the scope of the findings. To strengthen the impact of this study, we would recommend increasing the sample size, incorporating objective usage metrics, and conducting longitudinal assessments to track behavior changes over time. Additionally, establishing peer-to-peer learning networks could also address the gap in technical support, enhancing adoption and sustainability.

Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain
We propose conducting an experiment to identify the factors that promote the adoption and use of installed solar water heaters in households. These devices are high-cost, yet residents often lack the technical means and financial resources for proper maintenance. The experiment will assess strategies to promote the use of solar energy among indigenous migrant populations living in the metropolitan area of the city. 

This study revealed that only 9% of surveyed households used the solar water heater as their sole source of hot water, while 45% used it in combination with other devices, and the remaining households did not use it at all. 

Interestingly, those who used the solar water heater rated it positively. Meanwhile, those who did not use it cited reasons such as a lack of information about its operation, unawareness of simple user-managed solutions, a lack of interaction with neighbors who had positive experiences, installation difficulties, or minor adjustments that could have been resolved with proper technical support. In sum, the survey demonstrated that a well-functioning technology is often disregarded when it is not properly installed or when users lack sufficient information about its use. 

The findings highlighted that training, the positive influence of other users, and technical support are key factors in optimizing the use of solar water heaters and ensuring their full integration into the daily lives of beneficiary families. All identified problems had relatively simple and low-cost solutions, suggesting that an experiment could help determine the impact of these solutions on the adoption and usage of the devices. 

Building on these insights, the proposed experiment seeks to measure the impact of specific informational interventions on the perception and use of solar water heaters. 

A ""shock of information"" will be implemented in two formats: one providing objective technical information and the other leveraging social norms, using testimonials from neighbors who have successfully optimized their use of these devices. 

This experiment will assess changes in users' opinions about solar water heaters and in the willingness of non-users to adopt them before and after the intervention. It will identify effective strategies to enhance the adoption and optimization of solar energy use. The results will serve as inputs for future communication campaigns, strategies, and solutions aimed at expanding access to renewable energy solutions by promoting the adoption of solar water heaters and optimizing their use for current users. 

Given the high cost of the already installed equipment and the difficulty of accessing new technologies in the region, this experiment is essential to ensuring the energy sustainability of families (https://www.undp.org/es/argentina/publicaciones/spotlight-renewable-energy-solutions-mapping-argentina) who already have these devices on their rooftops. The combination of the restoration project with the experiment will not only improve the existing infrastructure but also generate replicable knowledge for other regions facing similar challenges.

Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?
The results of this experiment will be presented in collaboration with the Jujuy Institute of Housing and Urban Development (IVUJ) and the government of Jujuy, with the aim of informing authorities about the issues identified in the diagnosis. Additionally, these results can be shared with the Argentine Network of Municipalities Facing Climate Change (RAMCC), a coalition of municipalities and communes that coordinates and promotes strategic plans to address climate change in Argentina and other Latin American countries. Lastly, the findings can be shared with networks of local governments that UNDP is in contact with.

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?
The main learnings include identifying technical and training barriers as the biggest obstacles to the adoption of renewable technologies, and the importance of continuous support to maximize the project's benefits. On the one hand, the technical barriers include the incorrect orientation of the device on rooftops, poor installation, and the incompatibility of housing infrastructure with the water heaters. On the other hand, the training barriers involve the lack of follow-up after installation, as there was no support to help users navigate the learning curve of integrating a new device with these characteristics into their daily lives. Moreover, a support network within the community could facilitate the exchange of experiences and solutions among neighbors, who have often demonstrated an ability to solve problems creatively and independently.

Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?
First, the results may be of interest to the country office. In particular, the environment &amp; sustainable development department can benefit from the findings of this experiment, as they promote the integration of environmental considerations into the development process, driving projects that contribute to sustainability and the fight against poverty. Additionally, they support the development of public policies at both general and territorial scales.  On the other hand, these results may also be relevant to the inclusive growth department, as it works with vulnerable populations, particularly those that could benefit from cost-saving initiatives.   

Second, these findings could be of interest to laboratories in other countries working on similar topics, as well as to RBLAC and other bureaus.

Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?
The results of this experiment could be beneficial for various sectors beyond UNDP. Firstly, both the Argentine government and public policy designers could directly benefit by obtaining key information to implement similar initiatives in other regions, promoting access to renewable energy in vulnerable communities. They could use the results as a valuable tool, providing a model for public policies that seek to integrate sustainable energy solutions into social housing programs.

Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?
In the initial phase of the research and development initiative, a first iteration was conducted through an exploratory study, which involved diagnosing the current situation of the households benefiting from the policy. Subsequently, efforts have been focused on securing funding for a new experiment, which could involve multiple iterations, although these have not yet been defined as they are still being designed.

What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?
This initiative for installing solar water heaters was carried out in 2016 and 2017. In this regard, conducting a situational diagnosis and user typology analysis prior to the experiment was crucial, as there was no initial information on the state of the households, especially given that the solar energy solutions had been installed some time ago. This type of diagnosis is necessary even for more recent initiatives, where it is not always clear whether people have adopted the solution. Through this process, users can be classified into five categories to formulate relevant questions.   

Second, territorial diversity must be considered. In our case, although most of the households were public housing, there was socioeconomic diversity among users, which could lead to different lines of inquiry. Not all users necessarily had economic need as their primary motivation for using renewable energy.   

Finally, this initial diagnosis has limitations, as the results cannot be extrapolated to the entire population. Therefore, more in-depth studies should be conducted to enhance confidence in the findings.

Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?
This experiment can be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs. The methodology used (diagnostics, surveys, in-depth interviews, and focus groups) can be applied to other sustainable technology projects in sectors such as access to clean water, clean energy, health and well-being, or sustainable infrastructure. It is necessary to consider the infrastructure and local context in this experiment, since it depended on the high solar radiation in Jujuy, meaning that implementing a similar project in areas with lower sunlight levels would necessitate technological adjustments to ensure efficiency.  

Additionally, it needs to be considered the cultural adaptations to other local characteristics. Each community has its own unique barriers to adoption, levels of awareness, and communication networks. Some may require more extensive training and engagement strategies, while others may naturally share knowledge and experiences more effectively. Therefore, understanding local behavioral patterns and social structures is crucial.

How much the ""sense"" and ""explore"" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?
The ""sense"" and ""explore"" phases of the learning cycle were crucial in shaping this experiment, especially in collaboration with the EcoAndina Foundation, previously mapped by UNDP’s solution mapping area (as mentioned in the renewable energy report in Argentina). This early connection not only facilitated the identification of a strategic partner but also allowed the project to benefit from the foundation's experience and expertise in design and implementation. In hindsight, it would have been beneficial to delve deeper into the ""exploration"" phase with the Solution Mapper and Explorer to better anticipate the technical and adoption challenges faced by users of the solar water heaters.

What surprised you?
The biggest surprise was the resistance to change among beneficiaries, highlighting the need for comprehensive training and continuous technical support to ensure the effective adoption of sustainable technologies in vulnerable contexts. All the problems had relatively simple solutions. Technical problems included the incorrect orientation of the device on rooftops, poor installation, and the incompatibility of housing infrastructure with the water heaters. Another issue was the lack of follow-up after installation, as there was no support to help users navigate the learning curve of integrating a new device with these characteristics into their daily lives. Moreover, a support network within the community could facilitate the exchange of experiences and solutions among neighbors, who have often demonstrated the ability to solve problems creatively and independently."

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
The primary goal of the experiment is to foster the participation of Persons with Disabilities (PwD) in peacebuilding initiatives by establishing strategic alliances and ensuring security through the following actions.

1. Identifying key strategies to integrate inclusion and a disability-focused approach into the project with Norway.

2. Positioning UNDP within the ecosystem and advancing the disability policy agenda.

Key dependent variables include:

- Otherness, understood as the perception of PwD as equals and essential contributors to the construction of social peace.

- Empathy, encompassing both affective and cognitive empathy, fostered through direct exposure to personal life stories and shared spaces.

- Articulation, defined as the ability to collaborate with the ecosystem to promote the social and productive inclusion of signatories, victims, and participants with disabilities.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
If meeting spaces are facilitated, then empathy towards signatories, victims and participants with disabilities will increase.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
Yes, a different group entirely

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
To assess the impact of creating a dedicated space for interaction and recognition of Persons with Disabilities (PwD) on fostering empathy (reducing biases and increasing willingness to include), a controlled test was designed with two distinct phases.

These phases aim to connect decision-makers with the experiences and capabilities of signatories, victims, and participants with disabilities. The key variable is the frequency of interaction with PwD. The experiment includes two groups:

Control Group: Members of civil society, randomly selected.

Treatment Group: Individuals who visit the gallery and participate in the workshop.

The evaluation instrument used was a questionnaire designed to measure levels of empathy and potential biases toward signatories, victims, and participants with disabilities. This instrument was administered to up to 30 individuals in each group..

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The results of the experiment broadly validate the initial hypothesis, demonstrating a positive disposition among participants toward individuals with disabilities. From a behavioral perspective, this shift reflects a progression from otherness to empathy, enabling collective action and fostering collaborative efforts in both the short and medium term.

In contrast, survey results from members of civil society without direct connections to the disability or reintegration ecosystem reveal tendencies aligned with otherness, antipathy, and segregation.

The hypothesis underlying the experiment posits that individuals with prior sensitization exhibit greater empathy and a heightened willingness to collaborate with people with disabilities. This readiness, whether observed before or after an intervention, is attributed to their cognitive and social exposure to the realities faced by individuals with disabilities.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
To foster empathy and facilitate collective action for the social inclusion of signatories, victims, and participants with disabilities, the following recommendations are proposed:

Invest in Awareness: Develop and promote programs and activities aimed at increasing disability awareness. Such initiatives can significantly impact by transforming biases, attitudes, and behaviors, thereby fostering greater empathy and recognition of otherness.

Understand the Population Spectrum and Stakeholder Map: It is essential to identify where individuals and stakeholders fall on the spectrum of awareness and empathy. This understanding will enable resources, investments, and efforts to be directed toward building alliances that enhance and support collective action. This approach prioritizes complementing and enabling collaboration rather than solely generating emotional and cognitive empathy.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
The purpose of the pilot in Bogotá D.C. is to reduce and redistribute unpaid care and support work and to guarantee the rights and empowerment of persons with disabilities, as well as women caregivers of persons with disabilities.

In coordination with the Bogotá Mayor's Office, the experiment will be conducted in the Care Blocks and Support Centers for People with Disabilities. The experiment is currently in the design phase.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
If the district care system is strengthened through the inclusion of support services, then the personal

autonomy of women caregivers and people with disabilities will increase.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
Yes, a different group entirely

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
The Portfolio is integrated for three experiments that are proved with  women caregivers of people with disabilities and people with disabilities, who are generating caregiving burdens unnecessarily.

• Experiment 1. Integrated services and inclusive infrastructure. It is assumed that the district care system does not integrate support services or have effective communication channels for persons with disabilities. The

support centers do not integrate services aimed at women caregivers of persons with disabilities.

• Experiment 2. Dispersion and delivery of assistive devices. Assumes that support services for persons with disabilities are relatively expensive, which limits their access and use.

• Experiment 3. Behavioral science based on trust. Assumes that caregivers and persons with disabilities are wary of delegating care and/or accessing public support services.

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

The user research involved a review of the EPR legislation, and of international and local initiatives including those carried out by the global Accelerator Lab network. We also conducted internal consultations with UNDP teams and over 20 interviews with key stakeholders in Tbilisi and Zugdidi. As for the workshop, it was co-organised by the Waste Management/EPR organisation “Wasteless”, an association specialising in electronic waste management. The workshop was attended by representatives of the local CSOs, academia, youth organisation, and media.  \n\nWe partnered with local behavioural experts (BISC Partners) to co-design and test solutions addressing the key findings of the workshop and user research. Our collaboration with BISC Partners kicked off with an Initiation Workshop, organised in Zugdidi. The purpose of the workshop was for the experts to gauge the local stakeholders' experiences related to the target behaviour (sustainable e-waste disposal), agree on the segmentation of the target population for further Behaviour Drivers analysis, and start assessing potential intervention opportunities collaboratively.  \n\nFollowing the workshop and guided by BISC, AccLab conducted multiple in-depth interviews with key population segments (youth, housewives, waste management workers, tech repair companies and individuals, and tech industry professionals) to capture a range of behaviours and motivations for the research. BISC then analysed the in-depth interviews using two methods: (1) Behavioural Influence Framework: analysing the underlying motivations and deterrents shaping the behaviour of Zugdidi residents towards e-waste; and (2) “Value Goals”: exploring the functional, emotional and social drivers that could encourage them to get involved in e-waste collection and proper disposal.  \n\nThe behaviour mapping process drew the contours of potential entry points for our experiment. To test the ground for our ideas, we held one final consultation (Ideation Workshop) with the local stakeholders. There, BISC presented the findings of the in-depth interviews and behaviour mapping and facilitated groupwork on possible interventions using BIT EAST framework. The result was crowdsourced intervention concepts selected based on impact and feasibility of implementation. \n\nOnce the community consultations and subsequent behaviour mapping were finished, AccLab and BISC collaborated on designing a BI-informed experiment. The study comprised of 3 experiments: (1) increasing visibility and convenience of e-waste collection infrastructure in a retail setting; (2) testing the role of messaging strategies in residential contexts (targeting vulnerable IDP communities); and (3) leveraging schools as hubs for social and educational influence, aiming to embed long-term, community-wide behavioural changes. In conjunction with the experiments, an observation phase was planned to document real-world e-waste disposal behaviours and motivations through qualitative observations, self-reported data, and quantitative disposal metrics in public settings, focusing on a local FabLab and library to capture diverse participant profiles. Together, these experiments were designed to address both the structural barriers (e.g., accessibility and infrastructure) and socio-psychological dynamics (e.g., norms, awareness, and messaging), bridging the intention-action gap – a common phenomenon where individuals’ stated intentions to engage in sustainable behaviours fail to translate into actions. The monitoring phase lasted 3 weeks at the end of which the quantitative and qualitative data were analysed to reveal the unique challenges and opportunities in e-waste collection in Zugdidi. "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:""}, {""id"": ""b175e457-b70b-419e-9224-9adc45971904"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""checklist"", ""level"": ""media"", ""options"": [{""id"": 0, ""name"": ""Civil Society"", ""checked"": true}, {""id"": 1, ""name"": ""Academia"", ""checked"": true}, {""id"": 2, ""name"": ""Private Sector"", ""checked"": true}, {""id"": 3, ""name"": ""Government (&amp; related)"", ""checked"": true}, {""id"": 4, ""name"": ""United Nations"", ""checked"": true}], ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)""}, {""id"": ""299fd5fe-5341-4fb1-b77c-426543f6c538"", ""name"": ""total_cost"", ""type"": ""radiolist"", ""level"": ""meta"", ""options"": [{""id"": 0, ""name"": ""Less than 1,000 USD"", ""checked"": false}, {""id"": 1, ""name"": ""Between 1,000 and 9,999 USD"", ""checked"": false}, {""id"": 2, ""name"": ""Between 10,000- and 20,000 USD"", ""checked"": true}, {""id"": 3, ""name"": ""More than 20,000 USD"", ""checked"": false}], ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?""}, {""id"": ""39fe3cc3-8332-4651-9eb8-88991640524e"", ""src"": ""uploads/8605976a-c3d4-42a6-ba81-42a8d39dce56/a241e301180d57a7ede7c5faee70054d.png"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""scale"": ""original"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""center"", ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.""}, {""id"": ""cce1964d-3f39-4446-b509-c095fdc6c2c9"", ""src"": null, ""html"": """", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""left"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": ""Please upload any supporting links""}], ""title"": ""Design"", ""structure"": [{""id"": ""cf2a3b9a-e7fa-4811-af30-355ce2d59dd8"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": true, ""is_excerpt"": true, ""instruction"": ""What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

While each experiment and observation phase revealed unique challenges and opportunities, the overarching findings underscore the importance of integrating behavioural, structural, and educational strategies for fostering sustainable waste management practices. By addressing logistical barriers, extending interventions, and leveraging community engagement, future initiatives can build on these insights to achieve broader and more sustained participation in e-waste disposal. These lessons hold relevance not only for Zugdidi but also for other communities seeking to improve e-waste management systems.   "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The community consultations (including key stakeholder surveys, three workshops in Zugdidi, and in-depth interviews) helped us gauge Zugdidi residents’ perceptions and behaviours regarding e-waste collection and disposal. However, even more importantly, practicing active listening allowed us to genuinely empathise with our target audience’s perspective, build local social capital, earn the trust of our partners, and engage all stakeholders with greater intention, enthusiasm, and a shared sense of purpose. The true rewards of listening and building social capital in Zugdidi became evident when local partners took the initiative and proposed ideas for the project’s future. We realised that, regardless of the project timeline, such interventions should focus on continued engagement with community ecosystems for ownership and sustainability.\n\nWe also learned that the initial assumptions do not always hold true and that it is the unexpected findings of action research that often provide the most valuable insights. Initially, we hypothesized that most e-waste would be collected at schools because (1) a large concentration of youth are present in schools, (2) community consultations indicated that students are particularly receptive to new ideas and behavioural changes, and (3) we had held an informational session on e-waste at one of the schools. The experiment, however, revealed that most e-waste was collected at the city library, whose director turned out to be a community leader, spreading the word not only among the library’s youth and adult visitors but also within his network of co-workers, friends, and family. While our initial assumptions were not entirely disproven - schools did, in fact, collect a significant amount of e-waste - we learned not to underestimate the power of civic leaders and the influence they have in mobilizing broader community support and participation. "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment?

To address this, we had to plan with flexibility in mind—ensuring that community consultations were completed before the elections to avoid overlapping with critical phases. We also accelerated key milestones, completing the segmentation, in-depth interviews, and behaviour mapping processes within just a few weeks. Last but not least, leveraging the combination of CO institutional memory in innovation and novel knowledge brought by AccLab's new members played a pivotal role in navigating the uncertainties involved.\n\n(2) We also discovered that some partners were more challenging to bring on board than others, requiring us to rely heavily on creative problem-solving to uncover hidden opportunities and find more “unusual suspects”!  \n\n(3) Despite leadership support, we encountered the need to balance research needs against timeline and budgetary constraints, which were further exacerbated by lengthy operational processes for procurement of technical services. Investing in Lab's newcomers' training in operational skills proved essential in this regard. \n\nOverall, it was the vulnerability brought on by these obstacles that truly fuelled our learning.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
Globally, e-waste is escalating, with 62 million tons produced in 2022 and expected to reach 82 million tons by 2030, mostly unrecycled. In Georgia, e-waste management is established as a legislative priority, but local implementation remains challenging, underscoring the urgent need for effective strategies to address this issue.  

To bridge the circularity agenda with recovery efforts for conflict-affected vulnerable communities, the Accelerator Lab in Georgia is aligning national e-waste policy implementation in partnership with EPR Association ""Wasteless"" with grassroots action research and ecosystem building, in collaboration with the private sector, in Zugdidi, Georgia.  

The learning intent of the activity included:  

- To see if innovative approaches could be leveraged for contributing to policy implementation through community action; 

- To explore how curating and leveraging local ecosystems not directly involved in e-waste management could contribute to building sustainable e-waste management practices at the local level in Zugdidi.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
We hypothesized that by increasing the convenience and accessibility of e-waste disposal services, leveraging social norms through informative campaigns and engagement of schools as change agents, we would see an increase in the proper disposal and collection of e-waste across Zugdidi.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
Yes, a different group entirely
Yes, the same group but before the intervention

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
We initiated our collective intelligence exercise by conducting baseline user research, followed by a series of community consultations, starting with a design workshop for local stakeholders. The user research involved a review of the EPR legislation, and of international and local initiatives including those carried out by the global Accelerator Lab network. We also conducted internal consultations with UNDP teams and over 20 interviews with key stakeholders in Tbilisi and Zugdidi. As for the workshop, it was co-organised by the Waste Management/EPR organisation “Wasteless”, an association specialising in electronic waste management. The workshop was attended by representatives of the local CSOs, academia, youth organisation, and media.  

We partnered with local behavioural experts (BISC Partners) to co-design and test solutions addressing the key findings of the workshop and user research. Our collaboration with BISC Partners kicked off with an Initiation Workshop, organised in Zugdidi. The purpose of the workshop was for the experts to gauge the local stakeholders' experiences related to the target behaviour (sustainable e-waste disposal), agree on the segmentation of the target population for further Behaviour Drivers analysis, and start assessing potential intervention opportunities collaboratively.  

Following the workshop and guided by BISC, AccLab conducted multiple in-depth interviews with key population segments (youth, housewives, waste management workers, tech repair companies and individuals, and tech industry professionals) to capture a range of behaviours and motivations for the research. BISC then analysed the in-depth interviews using two methods: (1) Behavioural Influence Framework: analysing the underlying motivations and deterrents shaping the behaviour of Zugdidi residents towards e-waste; and (2) “Value Goals”: exploring the functional, emotional and social drivers that could encourage them to get involved in e-waste collection and proper disposal.  

The behaviour mapping process drew the contours of potential entry points for our experiment. To test the ground for our ideas, we held one final consultation (Ideation Workshop) with the local stakeholders. There, BISC presented the findings of the in-depth interviews and behaviour mapping and facilitated groupwork on possible interventions using BIT EAST framework. The result was crowdsourced intervention concepts selected based on impact and feasibility of implementation. 

Once the community consultations and subsequent behaviour mapping were finished, AccLab and BISC collaborated on designing a BI-informed experiment. The study comprised of 3 experiments: (1) increasing visibility and convenience of e-waste collection infrastructure in a retail setting; (2) testing the role of messaging strategies in residential contexts (targeting vulnerable IDP communities); and (3) leveraging schools as hubs for social and educational influence, aiming to embed long-term, community-wide behavioural changes. In conjunction with the experiments, an observation phase was planned to document real-world e-waste disposal behaviours and motivations through qualitative observations, self-reported data, and quantitative disposal metrics in public settings, focusing on a local FabLab and library to capture diverse participant profiles. Together, these experiments were designed to address both the structural barriers (e.g., accessibility and infrastructure) and socio-psychological dynamics (e.g., norms, awareness, and messaging), bridging the intention-action gap – a common phenomenon where individuals’ stated intentions to engage in sustainable behaviours fail to translate into actions. The monitoring phase lasted 3 weeks at the end of which the quantitative and qualitative data were analysed to reveal the unique challenges and opportunities in e-waste collection in Zugdidi.

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The study explored the effectiveness of behavioural interventions and observational strategies in promoting e-waste disposal in Zugdidi, building on recommendations to improve accessibility and leverage social norms through targeted campaigns, with three experiments and an observational phase examining how visibility, messaging, education, and context influence engagement. 

The first experiment showed that increasing visibility and accessibility alone did not significantly change behaviour, with no e-waste contributions during the intervention phase, highlighting the importance of contextual factors like a depleted e-waste pool and the lack of financial incentives. 

The second experiment showed that messaging strategies, particularly environment-focused messaging, significantly increased e-waste disposal rates, while site-specific challenges like theft and vandalism highlighted the importance of secure infrastructure in promoting engagement. 

The third experiment found that while school-based educational programs slightly increased the diversity of e-waste collected, overall disposal rates were similar to the control group, suggesting that longer-term efforts and improved logistics are needed for sustained behavioural change. 

The observational phase revealed higher e-waste engagement at the Zugdidi Library, driven by social influence and visibility, while the local FabLab had lower participation due to limited foot traffic, highlighting the importance of location-specific factors. 

Overall, the study provided valuable insights into the behavioural and contextual factors influencing e-waste disposal in Zugdidi. While each experiment and observation phase revealed unique challenges and opportunities, the overarching findings underscore the importance of integrating behavioural, structural, and educational strategies for fostering sustainable waste management practices. By addressing logistical barriers, extending interventions, and leveraging community engagement, future initiatives can build on these insights to achieve broader and more sustained participation in e-waste disposal. These lessons hold relevance not only for Zugdidi but also for other communities seeking to improve e-waste management systems.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
We learned that understanding the user’s needs through listening and building trust are essential for fostering the empathy required to gain user traction. The community consultations (including key stakeholder surveys, three workshops in Zugdidi, and in-depth interviews) helped us gauge Zugdidi residents’ perceptions and behaviours regarding e-waste collection and disposal. However, even more importantly, practicing active listening allowed us to genuinely empathise with our target audience’s perspective, build local social capital, earn the trust of our partners, and engage all stakeholders with greater intention, enthusiasm, and a shared sense of purpose. The true rewards of listening and building social capital in Zugdidi became evident when local partners took the initiative and proposed ideas for the project’s future. We realised that, regardless of the project timeline, such interventions should focus on continued engagement with community ecosystems for ownership and sustainability.

We also learned that the initial assumptions do not always hold true and that it is the unexpected findings of action research that often provide the most valuable insights. Initially, we hypothesized that most e-waste would be collected at schools because (1) a large concentration of youth are present in schools, (2) community consultations indicated that students are particularly receptive to new ideas and behavioural changes, and (3) we had held an informational session on e-waste at one of the schools. The experiment, however, revealed that most e-waste was collected at the city library, whose director turned out to be a community leader, spreading the word not only among the library’s youth and adult visitors but also within his network of co-workers, friends, and family. While our initial assumptions were not entirely disproven - schools did, in fact, collect a significant amount of e-waste - we learned not to underestimate the power of civic leaders and the influence they have in mobilizing broader community support and participation.

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?
We learned that the ideal scenario is never the real scenario and that innovation is a continuous journey of taking risks, confronting limitations, adapting to barriers, making pivots, iterating, and learning. We encountered several obstacles throughout our e-waste experiment: 

(1) One challenge we faced was the timing of our project coinciding with the months leading up to and following the general elections, which likely diverted the focus of Zugdidi residents away from our initiative. To address this, we had to plan with flexibility in mind—ensuring that community consultations were completed before the elections to avoid overlapping with critical phases. We also accelerated key milestones, completing the segmentation, in-depth interviews, and behaviour mapping processes within just a few weeks. Last but not least, leveraging the combination of CO institutional memory in innovation and novel knowledge brought by AccLab's new members played a pivotal role in navigating the uncertainties involved.

(2) We also discovered that some partners were more challenging to bring on board than others, requiring us to rely heavily on creative problem-solving to uncover hidden opportunities and find more “unusual suspects”!  

(3) Despite leadership support, we encountered the need to balance research needs against timeline and budgetary constraints, which were further exacerbated by lengthy operational processes for procurement of technical services. Investing in Lab's newcomers' training in operational skills proved essential in this regard. 

Overall, it was the vulnerability brought on by these obstacles that truly fuelled our learning. We embraced risks, adapted to challenges, learned from our setbacks, and approached problems with creative solutions, constantly seeking alternative paths to drive our project forward. In other words, we really learned to truly trust the process, embracing both its ups and downs."

Excellent. The written expression used is eloquent, clear, and succinct. You enjoyed learning about the experiment and were able to understand it without difficulty.



Excellent. The learning intent is clearly stated through a meaningful hypothesis. You were able to easily understand the expected effect of an action, and the value of learning if such effect occurs.




Excellent. The experiment clearly presents evidence and uses it correctly. You were able to easily understand how observations are used to test the hypothesis, and conclusions recognize the level of uncertainty.



Excellent. The experiment shows extraordinary novelty and insight. You were impressed by the ingenuity for solving a challenge in a new way and the thoughtfulness of insights provided.



No particular risk. No ethical, sensitivity, reputational or other risks were identified.



Excellent. The tags used are very useful. You consider the tags are relevant, accurate, and at the right level of detail. They allow to link the experiment with related work.



Overall recommendation: Is this pad ready for publication?

Excellent. The written expression used is eloquent, clear, and succinct. You enjoyed learning about the experiment and were able to understand it without difficulty.



Excellent. The learning intent is clearly stated through a meaningful hypothesis. You were able to easily understand the expected effect of an action, and the value of learning if such effect occurs.




Excellent. The experiment clearly presents evidence and uses it correctly. You were able to easily understand how observations are used to test the hypothesis, and conclusions recognize the level of uncertainty.



Excellent. The experiment shows extraordinary novelty and insight. You were impressed by the ingenuity for solving a challenge in a new way and the thoughtfulness of insights provided.



No particular risk. No ethical, sensitivity, reputational or other risks were identified.



Excellent. The tags used are very useful. You consider the tags are relevant, accurate, and at the right level of detail. They allow to link the experiment with related work.

Excellent. The learning intent is clearly stated through a meaningful hypothesis. You were able to easily understand the expected effect of an action, and the value of learning if such effect occurs.




Excellent. The experiment clearly presents evidence and uses it correctly. You were able to easily understand how observations are used to test the hypothesis, and conclusions recognize the level of uncertainty.



Excellent. The experiment shows extraordinary novelty and insight. You were impressed by the ingenuity for solving a challenge in a new way and the thoughtfulness of insights provided.



No particular risk. No ethical, sensitivity, reputational or other risks were identified.



Excellent. The tags used are very useful. You consider the tags are relevant, accurate, and at the right level of detail. They allow to link the experiment with related work.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

This activity was developed to establish foundations for increased collaboration and complementarity between UN Agencies in Gender Equality programming.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If UN Agencies can discuss about their activities regarding gender equality and women's empowerment, in a structured and strategic way, they will be able to extract insights to develop a joint action plan and establish complementary partnerships.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

A one day Sensemaking workshop was organized with Gender focal points for each resident UN Agency (11 Agencies), followed by intelligence sessions with a smallest group from the UN Gender Working Group to discuss the insights and create the final intelligence report.

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

United Nations

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

Less than 1,000 USD

Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.
Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The hypothesis was proven, insights generated were used to establish new complementary partnerships and develop a Gender Working Group Action Plan.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

The experiment helped to extract 6 emerging insights to support strategic action: 

Need to prioritize gender-related vulnerable groups in GEWE projects and interventions (LGBTQI+, AGYW) and intersections (PwD, rural communities, PLHIV, etc.)

Need for more data and information sharing for enhanced collaboration and joint planning;

Need for tailored program to promote women's economic empowerment.

Need to re-think gender and LGBTQI+ capacity building (Gov, CSO's, UN...)

Need to re-think existing funding models and efforts to achieve global access to justice and rights.

Need to measure the effects of the gender-sensitive impacts of climate change on poor rural populations, women and young people

The Sensemaking exercise allowed to explore insights and identify gaps and  opportunities for synergies and increased knowledge about the work developed.

Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

This experiment led to partnerships
This experiment led to adoption of new ways of working by our partners

Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report.

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

One of the main obstacles was encouraging sharing outside of the project mindset, including human interest stories and narratives to be able to extract hidden insights. The second obstacle was in the development of intelligence phase for which it is encouraged to envolve a smaller strategic group instead of the entire working group and focus on analyzing the data and information extracted during the sensemaking workshop. For additional deep dives into the data from each agency, a separate work can be developed."

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
This experiment was designed to evaluate how creating an invite-only, safe event environment could foster open dialogue and meaningful engagement among participants and stakeholders. The event intentionally provided a secure, intimate setting that encouraged attendees to share their personal stories and experiences in STEM while also giving partners direct access to these insights to better understand systemic challenges.

Key elements of the design included:

Invite-only format: Carefully curated participant list to ensure a safe and supportive environment, including women professionals, students, and academics in STEM.

Safe space for dialogue: Designed as a judgment-free setting to allow for honest conversations about challenges, opportunities, and successes in STEM.

Networking opportunities: Facilitated interaction among attendees to encourage community building and peer support.

Partner engagement: Stakeholders were invited to listen to firsthand accounts from participants, helping them develop more informed strategies to address barriers for women in tech.

Learning Intent:

To determine whether an exclusive, supportive event format can effectively amplify the voices of women in STEM, foster meaningful connections, and provide partners with actionable insights from direct participant engagement.

Importance:

Addressing gender imbalances in STEM requires deep understanding of the lived experiences of girls and women in the field. Traditional event formats often fail to create the safe spaces needed for honest dialogue. This experiment tested whether an invite-only format could overcome these challenges and lead to more impactful outcomes.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
An invite-only event that prioritizes safety and inclusivity will encourage greater participant engagement, foster networking, and provide stakeholders with valuable insights to inform gender-responsive strategies in STEM.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
Participants included 55 individuals, primarily women in STEM, ranging from students to professionals and academics. This group was selected to ensure diverse perspectives while maintaining a safe and supportive space for dialogue. Additionally, development partners and national partners attended the event, providing them with a unique opportunity to hear firsthand accounts from participants. Their presence was essential for gaining deeper insights into systemic challenges and for informing gender-responsive policies and initiatives in STEM.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
Learning Intent:
The experiment sought to determine if using an interactive tool like Mentimeter could effectively capture and amplify diverse perspectives during a public event. By gathering real-time data, the experiment aimed to identify systemic barriers, actionable solutions, and emerging priorities for advancing women in STEM.

Why It Is Important:
Traditional event formats often limit audience participation, particularly in sensitive topics such as gender equity in STEM. By testing the Mentimeter app, the experiment addressed key challenges:

- Amplifying underrepresented voices.
- Enabling a data-driven approach to dialogue.
- Ensuring the event's conclusions were informed by diverse, real-time feedback.




The insights gained not only enhanced the event’s inclusivity but also provided a replicable model for integrating audience engagement tools in future events or discussions.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
Hypothesis: Using an interactive app like Mentimeter would:

... Enhance audience participation.
.., Provide actionable insights during the event.
... Highlight diverse perspectives, enabling a more inclusive dialogue.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
This experiment leveraged the Mentimeter app to enhance audience engagement during the ""Her Journey, Her Story: Women Shaping Tech"" event. By enabling real-time interaction, the app allowed participants to share insights on systemic barriers, critical skills, and future opportunities for women in STEM. These live responses enriched the discussions, fostered an inclusive atmosphere, and contributed to actionable conclusions. The event attracted 55 attendees, including female students, STEM professionals, entrepreneurs, and academics, ensuring diverse perspectives on challenges and opportunities in the tech industry.

The experiment aimed to assess how real-time interactive tools like Mentimeter can effectively engage participants and enrich structured event discussions. Tailored, event-specific questions were developed to capture live feedback, which was displayed in real-time to guide and deepen conversations with the speakers. These questions focused on key themes such as barriers to advancement, necessary skills for success, and the value of diversity in technology.

Key elements of the experiment included:

Pre-event preparation: Developing questions that aligned with the event's goals and themes.
Real-time interaction: Collecting live responses from participants to create a dynamic feedback loop.
Post-event analysis: Analyzing the collected responses to derive key insights and inform future programming.

By using Mentimeter as the core engagement tool, the experiment stimulated active participation and captured audience perspectives that might have remained unheard in a traditional event format.

Event Size: 55 attendees
Data Collected: 39 responses across five Mentimeter questions

This experiment highlights the potential of interactive technologies to foster inclusivity, amplify diverse voices, and drive data-informed decision-making in event settings.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

We want to learn what are the main digital and soft skills that can increase the capacity of youth in rural areas and attract them to better jobs in the agriculture value-chains. We also want to understand to what extent digital and entrepreneurship training can support existing and new businesses for youth.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we introduce youth from rural areas to digital and entrepreneurship skills they will be more prepared and interested to create or enhance agriculture value-chain businesses in their communities.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

The pilot reached 20 youth from Cacuaco, Luanda with a 2 months digital and future skills program/curricula tailored to youth in rural areas and connected to Agribusiness.

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

Civil Society
Private Sector
Government (&amp; related)
United Nations

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

More than 20,000 USD

Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.
Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The hypothesis was proven. After the course ended, the students presented business plans which were entirely developed by them and prepared all the visuals and presentations. Some students that participated in the training continued using the acquired skills after training to develop new businesses and enhance existing businesses. After the course ended we have received invitations from groups of students who have been organizing learning sessions on digital skills and business skills, how to make food processing, soap making and candle making. Students have been using the skills acquired for marketing in social media and design flyers and materials to support their businesses.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

We have learned that there is a high capacity and willingness for entrepreneurship from youth in rural areas and high interest in digital tools. However, since young girls and women still have more challenges in daily lives there needs to be enhanced support for gender inclusion. Scaling-up will include additional support to girls and women to ensure inclusion.

Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

Solutions tested in this experiment were scaled in numbers
This experiment led to partnerships
This experiment led to resource mobilization

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Despite limited access to computers (only 4% have had access to a computer before the training), most participants possess basic cell phones and smartphones with internet access, highlighting the significance of mobile devices in their daily lives, particularly in areas where computers are less common. Gender-based disparities are evident, with a notable percentage of women not using computers, while men exhibit a more varied distribution in computer usage. In mobile phone skills, women tend to have higher confidence, but both genders exhibit significant gaps in software and internet-related challenges. The gender divide is also felt in the attendance and participation in the training. Many young girls between 19 to 25 years old have month old babies that they need to bring to the class, while others are forced to skip training sometimes due to childcare duties. While the pilot does not include dedicated childcare support, in future iterations this is critical to ensure equal access to training. 

Internet access is another important point. Half of the participants have access via mobile data, while others do not have internet access at home or at school/work. This highlights the need to ensure connectivity is affordable and available to everyone.

One positive finding was the widespread belief that digital tools can help solve problems and improve work or business. This suggests a positive attitude towards technology and an openness to learning and integrating digital tools into their lives. Participants are also very confident in their capacities and expressing a desire to continue using the skills they acquired after training, especially in ​​social media for business and graphic content creation. This indicates that practical and applicable skills are more likely to be retained and used in the future. Applications like Canva, used to create visual and graphic content, show limited use, but there is interest in learning and improving these skills. This indicates a possible demand for training in graphic design and visual content creation, valuable skills in digital marketing and communication.

The most common use of technology is to take pictures most participants mentioned that they use the phone camera to take pictures every day or at least twice a week. There is a clear trend of frequent use of popular applications such as WhatsApp and Facebook, indicating that participants are familiar and comfortable with communication platforms and social networks. This may reflect the importance of social communication and networking in their daily lives. However, the main reason behind the use of Facebook is that it is currently free to use in the country. Tools such as Microsoft Word and Excel show less frequent use, with many respondents indicating a lack of basic knowledge or skills. This suggests an opportunity to increase digital literacy and productivity software skills, which are essential in the modern workplace and specially when applied to businesses in the agriculture value-chains and cooperatives."

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
The learning intent of this experiment is to determine the causal effect of free Wi-Fi access on the number of visitors to public spaces, particularly tourist parks. By providing and promoting free internet connectivity, the experiment seeks to understand whether this intervention can attract more visitors and contribute to the revitalization of these spaces.

This experiment is important because it helps provide evidence on the role of digital infrastructure in enhancing public spaces. Understanding the impact of free Wi-Fi can guide policymakers, urban planners, and tourism organizations in designing interventions that improve the attractiveness and utility of public spaces. Moreover, the findings could inform strategies to support local businesses and community engagement by making public areas more accessible and appealing through enhanced connectivity. Additionally, it offers insights into the potential social and economic benefits of digital infrastructure in public spaces, which can support broader goals of urban development, digital inclusion, and economic growth.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
IF free Wi-Fi access is provided and promoted in public spaces, THEN the number of weekly visitors to those spaces will increase, contributing to their revitalization.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
Yes, a different group entirely

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
To test the hypothesis, I collaborated with the Salvadoran Tourism Institute (ISTU) to select 12 public parks and, including Balboa Park. In March 2024, we implemented free Wi-Fi access in Balboa Park and promoted it through Facebook and on-site materials. Over the following weeks, we tracked visitor numbers using administrative data provided by ISTU. We then compared the number of visitors before and after the Wi-Fi intervention, using synthetic control methods to estimate the counterfactual outcome for Balboa Park

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)
Private Sector
Government (&amp; related)

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
More than 20,000 USD

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The original hypothesis was rejected. However, while the free Wi-Fi did not lead to a statistically significant increase in the number of visitors to Balboa Park (compared to the control condition constructed synthetically), the results revealed that visitors who were already at the park perceived the Wi-Fi as an added value, improving their experience. This supports the idea that free connectivity enhances public space, but not in the way initially expected.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
The experiment revealed that free Wi-Fi in Balboa Park didn’t significantly increase visitor numbers, but enhanced the experience for those already present, improving perceptions by 18.8 points. Visitors informed about Wi-Fi stayed longer and were more likely to recommend the park, indicating high potential for customer satisfaction and loyalty, though spending didn't increase.

It was also recommended to ISTU to focus on digital literacy for small business owners to leverage free connectivity. Additionally, explore strategies to encourage visitor spending, such as targeted promotions or interactive digital content linked to the Wi-Fi network.

Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)
This experiment influenced public policy at a national or local level

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?
The main challenges included finding a valid control group due to Balboa Park's uniqueness, managed by employing the Synthetic Control Method. We also faced the challenge of managing ISTU’s expectations, as free Wi-Fi alone didn't significantly boost visitor numbers. Consistent data collection across businesses required close coordination.

Advice:

 1. Use Synthetic Controls when similar sites are unavailable, ensuring strong baseline data.
 2. Set clear expectations with stakeholders like ISTU about potential outcomes and limitations.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

This study aims to continue understanding the impact of leveraging places of worship as the center for encouraging sorting behaviour. This activity builds upon the work of the Indonesia Waste Donation Movement Program, which is supported by UNDP Indonesia, the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment, and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. It leverages domestic attitudes towards religion and generosity to encourage locals to ""donate"" their recyclable waste and adopt more sustainable waste management practices.
The research question of this study is is, ""Is there any indication that religious messaging influences waste sorting behaviour?"" This study also explores three supplementary questions to deepen the understanding and application of behavioural change concerning waste management: 1. To explore people's perceptions and intrinsic motivations regarding waste sorting behaviour; 2. To investigate the types, delivery methods, and content of religious messaging that affect waste sorting behaviour; 3. To examine whether the impact of religious messaging on waste sorting behaviour differs across religious communities.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

The hypothesis is that religious messaging influences waste sorting behavior.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

Yes, a different group entirely

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

The need for this study was jointly determined internally within the CO by the Accelerator Lab and the Marine Debris project. UNDP then partnered with Participate, an Indonesia CSO, to conduct this study. The methodology and approach was co-designed with local religious leaders of the places of worship that participated in this activity.

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

Civil Society
United Nations

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

Between 10,000- and 20,000 USD
Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The hypothesis was proven, as the amount of waste collected by treatment groups following the delivery of religious messaging was higher than the amount collected by the control groups each week.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

In an ideal setting, religious messaging holds the potential to enhance waste sorting efforts, potentially leading to a twofold increase in the amount of sorted waste collected.

Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

This experiment influenced public policy at a national or local level
Solutions tested in this experiment were scaled in numbers
This experiment led to partnerships
This experiment led to adoption of new ways of working by our partners

Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
The experimental activity design focused on understanding how farmers respond to climate adaptation messages. We conducted surveys with randomly assigned items, delivered through CAPI (Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing) to local farmers. By dividing participants into treatment and control groups, we tested if peer actions influence farmers’ willingness to adopt adaptive practices. Additionally, framing experiments examined how different contexts impact attitudes toward adaptation, and traditional knowledge tests assessed whether integrating indigenous practices with forecasts can build trust in official weather data.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
If farmers observe that their peers are adopting climate adaptation practices, then they will be more likely to adopt similar practices themselves.

If climate adaptation information is framed positively (e.g., emphasizing potential benefits), then farmers’ attitudes toward adopting adaptation measures will improve.

If traditional knowledge (such as wildlife behavior and lunar phases) is combined with official climate forecasts, then farmers’ trust in the accuracy and reliability of weather information will increase.

If climate information is delivered through accessible and familiar channels (e.g., WhatsApp groups), then farmers will be more likely to regularly use this information in their decision-making.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
Yes, a different group entirely

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
We designed and administered surveys where certain items (questions or statements) were randomized, meaning that different farmers received different versions of the survey. This random assignment helps us understand how varying pieces of information or framing can influence responses, as it controls for potential biases. The surveys were delivered directly to farmers in person using CAPI (Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing), a data collection method where enumerators use electronic devices, like tablets, to input responses in real time. This method improves data accuracy and speeds up the data collection process.

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The hypotheses were generally supported by the experiment's results. We hypothesized that if climate adaptation practices were framed as already adopted by local peers, farmers would show a higher motivation to implement these practices themselves. The results confirmed this: 87.5% of the treatment group—those informed about peer adoption—expressed motivation to adopt similar measures, compared to 76.7% in the control group.

Additionally, framing adaptation benefits versus risks differently influenced farmer perception. When information was framed negatively (risks of not adapting), it had a stronger impact, with 75% of farmers seeing climate change impacts as likely compared to 41% when presented positively. These findings highlight the influence of peer examples and loss aversion in climate adaptation motivation.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
Peer Influence Enhances Motivation: Farmers were more motivated to adopt climate adaptation practices when they perceived them as popular among their peers. This shows that a social proof approach can drive higher adoption rates in climate adaptation.

Framing Matters: Presenting information with a negative framing (emphasizing risks of inaction) proved more effective in making farmers feel the urgency of adapting to climate change than positive framing (emphasizing benefits of action). This highlights that loss aversion is a strong motivator in this context.

Trust in Traditional Knowledge: Farmers showed high confidence in traditional climate knowledge, and the combination of traditional insights with meteorological data seemed to foster even more trust. This indicates that integrating familiar, culturally resonant information with scientific data is likely more effective.

Preference for Mobile Access: Despite low internet access, farmers showed a preference for receiving information on mobile devices. This suggests that efforts to improve digital infrastructure could greatly enhance information reach.

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?
Limited Internet Access: Data collection was hampered by limited internet availability in rural areas, making it difficult to upload survey data in real time and requiring offline workarounds.

Geographic and Logistical Constraints: Reaching remote agricultural communities required extensive planning, both in terms of transport logistics and ensuring that data collection tools (e.g., tablets) were fully functional offline.

Technological Familiarity and Comfort: Many farmers were unfamiliar with digital devices, and some preferred traditional communication methods, which required careful adaptation of survey tools and materials.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

The specific learning objective of the activity is to understand whether small farmers, who are vulnerable populations, can take advantage of appropriate technologies and knowledge to improve their income while creating a direct link with consumers, who will be able to access better quality products at a better price.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the technology can help linking final consumers and farmers, then the final consumers will be able to purchase goods directly from the producer and by then make the value chains more sustainable

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

Yes, the same group but before the intervention

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Implement solutions to enhance the visibility and marketability of artisanal products through:

1- Online business education;

2- Enhanced marketing;

3- Integration onto global platforms;

4- Deployment of innovative technologies to differentiate and attract fair-trade conscious consumers.

- Quality &amp; Authenticity:

To tackle the quality issue head-on, we propose to use an ingenious solution involving an authentication to our platform. So, the customers that order their products can scan a QR code or another identification tag attached to the product they purchase. This QR allows our customers enables you to trace the origin of the product and find out which farmer produced it.

- Platform integration:

To increase their visibility and thus their sales, it is necessary to integrate existing platforms that are adapted to the characteristics of farmers and geared towards their customers (FAME for exemple, etc.).

- Secured sales:

To tackle the lack of trust regarding BtoB international sales, smart contracts solutions will be proposed through application like FAME. It will help to reassure Moroccan farmers vis-à-vis international traders, as well as guaranteeing that customers receive compliant products. 

Special features for craftsman products: Digitalization of Moroccan heritage to build on unique knowledge in terms of creations, designs, patterns, shapes, etc. and to preserve and monetize Moroccan heritage, we think that it will be important to record cultural artworks on blockchain.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
The digital divide is an issue that has been wisely addressed by governments across the world. Many rural and semi-urban women business owners of Cajamarca, Peru lack opportunities to expand their business to access broader markets through digital resources due to capability and access gaps. They hence needed digitalisation as a solid means by which to convert their businesses into a format that would survive (and possibly thrive) during the pandemic. The end-line need is to empower business-owning women to improve their businesses (and profits) through digitalisation.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
If we gather qualitative data on the needs of women business owners regarding the divide digial, then we can identify which aspects of the digital divide are most relevant to them.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
LSE MSc Student research collaboration with the UNDP Peru Accelerator Lab during two months, where the aim of the primary research - conversations with the ladies, organisations, professionals and researchers on the field - was to understand, with no assumptions, what the needs, current reality and gaps were. Extant literature pointed to several reasons for the existence of the digital divide, including gaps in capability, motivation, infrastructure and access, affordability, etc. These formed the hypotheses for the existence of the digital divide for the target group and need to be validated through primary research. The primary research would also aid in gathering insights into which among these were most relevant to the target group (the business-owning women) while accumulating qualitative data regarding their lived experiences and needs. The study was done at a local and micro (individual) level to address the deficiencies for the target group.

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)
Civil Society

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
Less than 1,000 USD
Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The hypothesis was proven, they needed digitalisation as a solid means by which to convert their businesses

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
The different methodologies ensured that there was an empirical understanding of the attitudes towards and need for digitalisation from the point of view of the target group (with a specific focus on different user profiles) while also ensuring that a more granular, qualitative understanding was obtained through the interviews (primary research). The aim was to maintain a balance between the research with the practical, human-centric approach to designing the intervention - aspects that the Accelerator Labs value in the work they do.

Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)
This experiment did not scale yet

Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
The COVID-19 pandemic represented an economic hit that endangered the sources of income for 300,000 entrepreneurs in the food markets and their families, but also enforced different social dynamics in a public space that used to be all about daily or weekly interactions and relationships between sellers and clients. The intent of  Innova Tu Mercado (Innovate your Market) is to accelerate the digital transformation of women entrepreneurs in the food markets in Peru, through an initial pilot in two markets: the Gran Mariscal Ramón Castilla and the Real Plaza Apromec - Ate Vitarte markets.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
If we women entrepreneurs receive specialized training then we can identify with them digital solutions to strengthen their economic recovery of food markets.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
Actions to Test the Hypothesis:

Workshops: Designed a methodology based on design thinking for six weeks to 28 women leaders of the markets 

Collaboration:

Worked with 25 undergraduate students from the Universidad del Pacífico.

Collaborative solutions reached: 

They presented user-centric solutions, in this case for first-time customers, regular customers, and other market entrepreneurs. These solutions were complementary among each other (just like the pain points that generated them) and built on previous advances made by the Peruvian Ministry of Production to close the digital gap found in food markets.

“Geo-Mercado” (Geo-market) and “Encuentra a tu casera” (Find your seller): Two tools to improve traffic in the market and locating entrepreneurs based on preference o product category (adaptable to different markets).  

“Tu Casera Favorita” (Your favorite seller): Site with seller information and current offers and sales.

Tukasero.com: UX improvements for this existing website (designed and implemented by the Ministry of Production).

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)
Academia
Government (&amp; related)
United Nations

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
Less than 1,000 USD
Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The original hypothesis—if we women entrepreneurs receive specialized training then we can identify with them digital solutions to strengthen their maket access and economic recovery of food markets—was proven.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
Most Important Learning Outcomes:

As the six weeks went by, we discovered that our biggest challenge was not in the number of hours per week we had with the Warriors nor in virtual meetings; it resided in clearly defining who was the user for each digital solutions and fully understanding the user before jumping into potential solutions that might sound great in paper but don’t really address their pain points. 

It’s not easy to be patient with a process that doesn’t seem to move as quick as we would like, but at the same time we didn’t expect how empathetic Warriors and students would be with each other when it came to learning about their difficulties during the pandemic. 

The importance of acknowledgement and recognition: The Innova Warriors have been leaders of their respective markets way before Innovate your Market started. However, recognizing them as Innova Ambassadors, or focal points for digital transformation and the future of food markets, has been fundamental to ensure consistent involvement in the learning path and give a renewed push to the development of digital solutions.

Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)
Solutions tested in this experiment were scaled in numbers
Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?
Main obstacles were the digital learning path at the beginning and the requiered of data the Warriors needed to access the workshops."

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
The activity was conducted to assess how mature the critical technology components of the Local Revenue Management Information System (LoRMIS).


The experiment was important to determine if prior gaps identified in the system were adequately addressed to confirm readiness of the system for implementation

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
IF gaps identified in the system are adequately addressed, THEN the system will have matured enough to be deployed.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
Yes, the same group but before the intervention

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
UNDP Accelerator Lab Malawi supported Mwanza District Council to refine their system for managing revenue from 2022.


In 2022 and 2023, the National Commision for Science and Technology (NCST) adapted and simplified NASA's technology readiness assessment framework.

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)
Academia
Government (&amp; related)

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
Between 1,000 and 9,999 USD

Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.
Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
Technology Readiness Results from iterations of assessment revealed that the system had progressed from Technology Readiness Level 3 to Technology Readiness Level 8. As such, the Testing Team recommended the implementation of the system.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
The technology readiness assessment questionnaire should be simplified and adapted in order to effectively measure the maturity of a technology.


Refinement of early innovative technologies should identify and focus on critical technology elements to address key assumptions.

Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)
Solutions tested in this experiment were scaled in numbers
This experiment led to resource mobilization
This experiment led to adoption of new ways of working by our partners
Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
The specific intent of this activity is to learn if automatically collected data on filled trashcans with uncollected waste can be used to nudge waste collectors to collect waste timely.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
IF we develop and launch a Smart Trashcan system with behavioural change techniques, THEN we can reduce the amount of unmanaged solid waste in Lilongwe City.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
Yes, a different group entirely

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
In 2021, UNDP AccLab Malawi engaged the Physics Department team of University of Malawi to programme sensors to detect levels of waste in a trashcan and send alerts to a dashboard.


In November 2021, Lilongwe City Council identified and liaised with 2 markets and 2 schools in Lilongwe City where 4 Smart Trashcans were tested.


From December 2021 to February 2022, management of the 2 markets and 2 schools monitored usages of the Smart Trashcans.


In February 2022, members of the Accelerator Lab and Lilongwe City Council visited the four sites, observed the state of the Smart Trashcans and interviewed the custodians of the Smart Trashcans on their experiences.

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
Between 1,000 and 9,999 USD

Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.
Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The original hypothesis was not proven because the device was attached to the wrong type of bins.
Secondly, the materials used to house the gadgets were not robut enough for outdoor use during rainy season.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
1. Current design of mounting on lids of trash cans does not effectively address the challenge since the small and portable trash cans are regularly emptied onto large skip bins. So, the refined Smart Trashcan should support skip bins. Secondly, mounting a solar panel on top of an easily accessible trash can lid makes it vulnerable to petty thieves. A proposed refinement is to redesign the smart trash can device for mounting on streetlight stands and have skip bins placed directly under the streetlights. 


2. Prototype materials such as wooden casing are not robust enough to withstand harsh weather and outdoor environments especially during the rainy season.  The recommendation is to use the casing of the streetlight poles to protect the gadgets from harsh weather.


3. Innovation champions at the site of deployment should be identified to safeguard and report on effectiveness of early-stage solutions.

Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)
This experiment did not scale yet
Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
This experiment intends to support the government in the development of NDC 3.0 by encouraging meaningful and active participation of relevant stakeholders in this process to ensure that NDC 3.0 appropriately considers the real short, medium and long-term mitigation, adaptation and enabler actions on climate change that address the interest of various stakeholders. The underlying purpose of this experiment plan is not just to engage stakeholders in the process but to test whether their insights or visions effectively influence the NDC development through using a participatory approach. The experiment also aims to test a hypothesis and the proposed solutions.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
If various stakeholders are well informed of the NDC 3.0 development process and given space or platform, they will meaningfully participate and contribute insights into the development process of NDC 3.0, which aims to reduce carbon emissions and build a resilient society.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
Yes, a different group entirely

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
The experiment employed several methodologies to engage various stakeholders to participate in the development of Cambodia NDC 3.0. Those methods include (1) Stakeholder mapping, (2) Strategic Foresight methods, including Road-mapping and Three Horizons Framework, (3) an Online Campaign, (4) Innovative Challenges, and (5) a Crowdsourcing platform.  These activities will be used to collect insight and input from different groups to inform different stages of the NDC 3.0 development.

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
In recent years, Peru has become a key destination for over 1.5 million Venezuelan migrants seeking better opportunities for themselves and their families. Migrants face major barriers in employment, access to basic services, and social integration in Peru and other countries in the region.


As part as our FC4, we knew that digitalization could a pathway for formalization, but becoming digital requires both structured support from a recognized organization as well as informal support at home or within the community that can help with accessing digital tools, promote social cohesion and financial inclusion simultaneously.


Framing our challenge as a “cause”, and having a constructive/positive approach to develop new narratives of migration became a powerful source of insights.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
If talent has no borders, if it is not constrained by geographical or cultural borders, then individuals from diverse regions will demonstrate exceptional abilities and achievements across various fields, irrespective of their location.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
Through a design process, we built four user profiles that reflect different archetypes of the migrant entrepreneur in Peru and then we involved allies that could provide knowledge and skills that could complement UNDP’s expertise. Therefore, UNDP Peru’s Poverty Reduction and Prosperity programme and the country office’s human mobility focal point - set out to find expert organizations in this topics that could become allies in this journey. Some of them were UN agencies or programmes, others were nonprofits that served the migrant community in Peru or academic partners, some were government agencies or even private financial sector businesses.

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)
Civil Society
Private Sector
United Nations

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
Between 10,000- and 20,000 USD
Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
Hypothesis proven: Talent has no borders.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
CREANDO evolved from a vertical top-down individual learning approach to a horizontal bottom-up collective learning approach with a renewed value proposition that also re-focused the key pillars of the CO’s activities related to migration. As a result, we offered a meaningful experience that motivated our users to open up and transfer us a sense of “hope” and social movement. 

Framing our challenge as a “cause”, and having a constructive/positive approach to develop new narratives of migration, boosted our stakeholders and users’ participation. Every step of the journey became a powerful source of insights. 

We didn’t expect the benefits to be twofold: Participants in CREANDO could gain access to the most up to date business tools, relevant knowledge about options about financial services and network with local business associations and incubators; but at the same time all these partners  were sensitized to the barriers faced by migrant entrepreneurs on a daily basis.

Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)
Solutions tested in this experiment were scaled in numbers
Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?
Challenges encountered: 

Migrant and Peruvian entrepreneurs are extremely busy with their businesses and don’t keep usual office hours, so we couldn’t expect them to have enough time to sit for a three hour long session.
Virtual trainings are mostly taken on the go as they perform other business activities, and mostly on cell phones and not on laptops or desktops, so using Mural isn’t always easy and data issues limit using videos or even joining for the full session.
Networking with people is essential and hearing about other entrepreneurs’ successes and failures helps in uncertain times.
Entrepreneurs need specific and practical information that can be immediately applied regardless of their industry."

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The activity seeks to learn how to integrate Indigenous Peoples' perspectives into national and local climate adaptation strategies through participatory Life Plans. It aims to understand how collective intelligence and traditional knowledge can enhance climate resilience and contribute to more inclusive planning processes.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is crucial because it bridges the gap between Indigenous knowledge and government strategies, empowering marginalized communities to play an active role in climate action and ensuring that national climate policies are both inclusive and effective​

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
IF Indigenous Peoples' perspectives are integrated into climate adaptation planning through participatory Life Plans, THEN local communities will be more empowered to take climate action, leading to more effective, inclusive, and resilient climate strategies at the municipal and national levels.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
Actions to Test the Hypothesis:
Collaborative Workshops:

Conduct workshops with Indigenous communities, government officials (Plurinational Authority of Mother Earth), and local representatives in Camiri to co-design Life Plans.
Stakeholder Involvement:

Engage with the Kaami Indigenous community, municipal government, and national stakeholders to incorporate their perspectives into climate adaptation planning.
Timeline and Location:

These actions were carried out during 2023 in the Chaco region, focusing on integrating Life Plans with broader municipal and national strategies.
Technology and Tools:

Use crowdsourcing, surveys, and 3D mapping tools to capture and visualize the communities' climate adaptation priorities

If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The original hypothesis—if Indigenous perspectives are integrated into climate adaptation planning, then more inclusive and effective climate strategies will emerge—was proven. The workshops with the Kaami Indigenous community and government stakeholders successfully integrated collective intelligence into the planning process. This led to better alignment between Indigenous Life Plans and broader municipal and national climate strategies, showing how traditional knowledge and official policies can work together for more resilient climate action​

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
Most important learning outcomes:
Greater inclusion: Indigenous communities were empowered to contribute to national and local climate strategies.
Closing knowledge gaps: Combining traditional indigenous knowledge with official data improved climate adaptation plans.
Effective use of collective intelligence: Tools such as 3D maps and surveys enabled deeper engagement and understanding.
Recommended changes:
Improved communication tools: further refine tools to better align indigenous knowledge with official terminology.
Broader participation: engage more indigenous communities to ensure broader impact across regions
Technology: the use of smartphones and applications must be reconsidered in places where the digital divide is extreme

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The experiment aims to explore how mobile units can improve the distribution of the Bono Juana Azurduy, increase prenatal care access, and boost effective benefit collection. The objective is to assess whether decentralized, on-the-ground services make it easier for pregnant women to access healthcare and financial support.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is crucial as it addresses accessibility barriers faced by women in underserved areas. It provides a solution to improve health outcomes, reduce time and costs, and enhance the effectiveness of social protection programs

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
IF mobile units are deployed to provide healthcare services and facilitate the collection of the Bono Juana Azurduy in underserved areas, THEN it will reduce the time, cost, and logistical barriers for pregnant women, leading to increased access to prenatal care and a higher rate of effective benefit collection.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
he experiment was proposed as a way to demonstrate the benefits of using mobile units for distributing the Bono Juana Azurduy and improving access to prenatal care. However, due to a change in the director, the execution was not carried out, and it remained a proposed experiment rather than being implemented. Data collected prior to execution provided evidence that further experimentation was necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mobile service model​

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The original hypothesis has been confirmed, since the results showed that the use of the mobile application and Big Data technology improved both waste collection and urban planning. The municipality was given a planning dashboard that allowed them to use real-time data collected by garbage trucks to optimize routes, address infrastructure issues and improve the overall efficiency of urban management. This shows that the integration of waste collection with urban planning data supports the hypothesis and provides concrete benefits for the municipality.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
Most important learning outcomes:
Multifunctional data collection integration: Garbage trucks can effectively collect data on both waste and urban infrastructure, improving municipal planning in real time.
Improved urban planning: Real-time data enabled more efficient route optimization and faster responses to infrastructure issues.
Changes:
Expand data collection capabilities: include more urban metrics (e.g. schools, green spaces).
Ongoing Training: Regularly train drivers to maintain data accuracy and efficiency.
System expansion: gradually expand the system to cover more areas and integrate other city services.

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?
Main obstacles and challenges:

1. Change of municipal authorities: the leadership transition interrupted the expansion and integration of the board into urban planning.
2. Political and administrative resistance: Difficulty in ensuring long-term adoption of the system due to changing priorities of the new authorities.
3. Technical and operational training: Ensuring consistent use of the platform required ongoing training and support.

Tips for colleagues:
1. Early stakeholder engagement: Involve municipal leaders early to build ownership.
3. Provide comprehensive training: regularly train staff and new authorities to maintain the use and relevance of the system."

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?
Understand how digital tools and participatory processes can improve citizen engagement in local governance.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
IF citizens are empowered through digital tools, THEN they will actively participate in local governance, leading to better decision-making, more inclusive policies and sustainable development outcomes. in their neighborhoods.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:
Before-and-after measurements: Tracking changes in citizen engagement, service delivery, and policy effectiveness before and after the implementation of the digital tools.
Inter-neighborhood comparisons: Examining differences between neighborhoods based on their level of engagement or data contributions to the platform, even if all are technically part of the experiment.
This approach ensures that the entire community benefits, aligning with the goal of inclusivity and no neighborhood left behind.

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?
The original hypothesis, which suggested that IF citizens are empowered through the “Mi Barrio” platform, THEN they will actively participate in local governance, IS supported based on the current results. The platform has become the main tool of the municipality, with the participation of more than 15 neighborhoods and 4 submunicipalities. This indicates that citizens are using the platform to participate and the municipality is adopting it for governance, showing positive movement towards the intended goals of greater participation and better governance.

What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?
Most Important Learning Outcomes:

Empowerment through Digital Tools: The platform successfully enabled citizens from more than 15 neighborhoods to engage with local governance, proving that digital tools can foster participation in the Bolivian context.

Community-Led Decision-Making: The experiment demonstrated that citizen data and feedback can shape municipal policies effectively, creating a closer relationship between residents and local government.

Scalability Potential: The success in multiple neighborhoods shows potential for expanding the platform to more areas.

Recommended Changes:

Expand Access: In a Bolivian context, ensuring wider internet access and digital literacy would help engage more citizens, especially in rural or underserved areas.

Localize Content Further: Tailoring content to specific regional languages or dialects could increase participation from diverse communities.

Enhanced Civic Training: Providing more robust training and support on how to use the platform could increase the depth of engagement and data quality.

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?
Main Obstacles and Challenges:

1. Digital Divide: Limited internet access and digital literacy in some neighborhoods made it challenging to ensure widespread participation.

2. Initial Citizen Engagement: Encouraging residents to actively use the platform required significant awareness campaigns and training.

3. Technical and Resource Constraints: The development and maintenance of the platform demanded technical expertise and continuous support.




Advice for Colleagues:

1. Invest in Digital Literacy and Access: Ensure that communities have the necessary tools and training to engage with the platform.

2. Build Strong Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and leaders to foster trust and drive participation.

3. Start Small and Scale Gradually: Begin with a few neighborhoods to refine the process before expanding."

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

This activity aims to understand in which ways polarization is affecting the work of public officials, what are the main drivers, and some opportunities to overcome the barriers imposed by polarization.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF a collective intelligence exercise is conducted with public officials, THEN relevant difficulties imposed by polarization to their work and opportunities to overcome them can be identified

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

No, it does not use a control group

How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

non-random assignment

Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We will gather public officials from different institutions into a three hour workshop. They will be guided to discuss on three issues: how polarization affects their work, what are the main drivers, and what are opportunities to mitigate the effects of polarization. The ideas will be gathered in post its and digitalized into a Mural for analysis through sensemaking. The results will be compiled and given back to participants and decision makers to inform policy decisions.

What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Each public institution

Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We collected qualitative data from participants in the workshops through post-its and then digitalized them using Mural.

What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

There are some logistical challenges that need to be overcome when there is such a large number of workshops and participants, each of them running for a short time. On the one hand, the goals of the workshop need to be limited and simple instructions. Then, there is a need to have multiple facilitators, and to complement the general facilitation with facilitation in each table with participants. It's important to constantly remind participants to write their ideas, as there is a tendency to only share them by speaking, and writen ideas are needed for analysis. Finally sensemaking of such a large amount of post-its required non trivial decisions on how to group and categorize the ideas. The final categories can be dependent on the level of abstraction and background of the person analyzing so they need to be revalidated with participants and other facilitators, eventually after a few iterations, key ideas do seem to converge.

From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Three months

What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

About USD10,000

Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. The results from the workshops are compiled and given back to participants to enable actions and decisions as well as to the high-level officials to advance the general government policy priority regarding legitimate and effective public service.

Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Besides diffusing the use of the results, it's potentially possible to replicate or adapt the methodology in other contexts.

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We know that polarization affects the work of public institutions in two main ways. On the one hand, it creates disfunctional relations among members of society. This leads to unreasonable social demands, lack of participation, apathy, and even aggression. On the other hand, it weakens institutions, creating mistrust from society, stagnation, lack of agreements, and ultimately reduces quality and coverage of services. 

Also, we learned that from the perspective of public officials, some actions to mitigate the effects of polarization include managing information both within and outside the institution, strengthening coordination between institutions, supporting the well-being of public servants, and promoting social participation.

What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

See the sections on observation to methodology.

Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The country office in general. Particularly, the RR benefited from the interaction with a large number of public institutions in the executive. Also the teams linked to dialogue and the human development report, as well as the governance team. They can use the results and methodologies for their own projects, and the relations with public institutions to promote additional sessions to listen the perspective of public officials.

Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Mainly the 60 public institutions that participated in the exercises. Also the presidency for learning priorities to be addressed and ways to support public officials to increase their effectiveness and legitimacy.

Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes. We iterated and improved the method in about seven rounds.

What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

See the section on main obstacles and observations to methodology.

Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Totally. The materials can be made available to replicate the workshops.

How much the ""sense"" and ""explore"" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense and exploration were important to identify the relevant institutions and actors to engage. Experimentation was important to design and implement the workshops. It was important to use exploration methodologies for the analysis of the results, and sensing for the facilitation of the workshops.

What surprised you?

We were surprised at how receptive public officials were, and their willingness to participate. It's is noticed that these exercises offer opportunities to public officials to develop, and learn tools they can apply within their institutions."

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The activity aims to learn if an adaptation of the methodology ""policy stress test"" is useful to analyze ways to promote dialogue and collaboration under different scenarios of polarization.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we adapt the methodology ""policy stress test"" THEN a group of experts can propose effective ways to promote dialogue and collaboration under different scenarios of polarization.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

No, it does not use a control group

How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

non-random assignment

Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We designed a workshop with a literature review of alternative policies to promote dialogue and collaboration. Then we invited the group of experts that previously participated in the construction of scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative ways to promote dialogue and collaboration under different scenarios of polarization. The experts needed to identify which policies offered more opportunities and less risks.

What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Focus group

Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We collected qualitative information from participants in the focus group and systematized it in a canvas using sensemaking.

What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

Three weeks.

What is the estimated sample size?

1

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

Less than 1,000 USD

Quality Check

This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
The hypothesis is clearly stated
This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
This activity offers a high potential for scaling
This activity has a low risk

What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

We need to design the workshop, analyze data to inform the design of the workshop, we need to facilitate the workshop, systematize the results, and access to computer and digital tools.
Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The methodology ""policy stress test"" was difficult to compress into a two hour workshop with high level participants. The original script was not followed precisely, so flexibility is needed to allow a smooth flow of the conversation. To do this the facilitator needs skills to keep track of the research objectives, manage time of the interventions, and quick synthesis of the contents to ensure the conversation stays relevant while participants feel comfortable. The group was quite diverse. It's important that the selection of participants was not random. Although participants needed to meet technical criteria regarding expertise in promoting dialogue, and diversity of experiences, they were also selected based on having a previous relationship of trust with the facilitator.

From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Three weeks.

What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

400 USD

Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. This activity followed a previous workshop to develop polarization scenarios. Also, this activity was followed by a report intended to influence public policy.

Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes. The results from this experiments were intended to complement the launch of the Human Development Report and offer guidance to public policy to improve the relations among public institutions and towards society.
Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We know that there are a wide range of alternatives to promote dialogue and collaboration. However, some are more appropriate in scenarios of high polarization, while others in scenarios of low polarization. In scenarios of low polarization, it's useful to not treat dialogue with all the formalities as this will miss opportunities. In those opportunity cases, it's valuable to increase the number and diversity of participants. Also, it's useful to incorporate digital technologies and disruptive exercises to increase the diversity of ideas and move more quickly to action. On the other hand, in challenging scenarios it's important to be prudent regarding sensitivities. It's important to prepare conditions for dialogue, take into account symbolysis associated with respect, maintain congruence between speech and action, enforced the mutually agreed rules, reduce barriers for honesty and manage difficult emotions.

What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Time constraints were an initial challenge. Also, it is challenging to gather a group of diverse experts in a context of high polarization, so to increase chances of success actors with previous relations. Also, it was difficult for participants to stay on topic, they often wanted to give long speeches, or only observe. Moreover, the list of alternatives considered for the scenarios were all consider valuable, so it was difficult to prioritize among them, so multiple prompts were needed.

Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The country office in general, particularly the teams linked to the Human Development Report and Governance. These teams can use the methodologies and findings in other activities.

Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The experts who participated in the workshops are able to use the methodologies and results. Also, public officials whose work is challenged by polarization can use the results to consider alternative ways to address the need for dialogue and collaboration.

Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Consider the recommendations laid out in ""main obstacles"".

Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. Policy stress test can be used for other goals beyond promoting dialogue and collaboration in scenarios of polarization.

How much the ""sense"" and ""explore"" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The exploration stage was important to identify policies promote dialogue to be evaluated. The sense was important to gather the experiences and recommendations from experts. The experimentation stage was important to design the workshops to test the methodology and evaluate the results.

What surprised you?

I was particularly surprised by the remarks about how important the coherence between action and speech are to gain trust, also the need to think about shared futures, as well as the importance of symbolic communication."

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The activity aims to learn if an adaptation of the methodology ""axis of uncertainty"" is useful to analyse scenarios of polarization.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we adapt the methodology ""axis of uncertainty"" THEN a group of experts can identify drivers of polarization and analyze future scenarios

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

No, it does not use a control group

How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

non-random assignment

Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We designed a workshop with background information about public opinion on polarized topics. Then we invited a group of experts in promoting dialogue in difficult situations to a focus group where the methodology ""axis of uncertainty"" was implemented. The expertes needed to identify which drivers of polarization have the most impact on polarization and also which of these drivers have the most uncertainty in their outcome.

What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Focus group

Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We collected qualitative information from participants in the focus group and systematized it in a canvas using sensemaking.

What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

Three weeks

What is the estimated sample size?

1

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

Less than 1,000 USD

Quality Check

This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
The hypothesis is clearly stated
This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
This activity offers a high potential for scaling
This activity has a low risk

Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.


What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

We need to design the workshop, analyze data to inform the design of the workshop, we need to facilitate the workshop, systematize the results, and access to computer and digital tools.
Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The methodology ""axis of uncertainty"" was difficult to compress into a two hour workshop with high level participants. The original script was not followed precisely, so flexibility is needed to allow a smooth flow of the conversation. To do this the facilitator needs skeels to keep track of the research objectives, manage time of the interventions, and synthesise quickly the content share to ensure the conversation stays relevant while participants feel heard and comfortable. The group was quite diverse, and this was important to continue in repliations.

From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Three weeks

What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

400 USD

Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. We followed up the initial workshop with a second workshop to stress test policies that promote dialogue and collaboration in the adverse and favorable scenarios developed in the initial workshop.

Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes. We plan to take the results of this experiment to inform exercieses to promote dialogue and collaboration with public institutions along with the difussion of the Human Development Report

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We know that to promote dialogue and collaboration it's importat to overcome the barriers imposed by polarization. We learned that key drivers of polarization include: discourse that evoques fear and hate; sanctions imposed to disidents; missinfomation; lack of emotional intelligence; interpersonal trust; capacity to defend from sanctions; and effectiveness of mediation.

What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

In a polarized context, understanding polarization can be challenging. Identifying a diverse group of experts with the willingness to engage in the workshop is not trivial. The strategy used was to take advantage of previous personal relations with dialogue leaders in different fielsd with whom trust was already stablished. And ensure the implementation of the workshop was conducted in a respectful way, with clear and anticipated results that were valued to all participants. This eneded up working well, as participants appreciated the opportunity to share a space with other participants, and exchanged contacts. We were not able to fullfill expectations to create a community, but we encouraged participants to take the lead.

Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The country office in general, particularly the teams linked to the Human Development Report and Governance, benefited from gaining insights regarind how to overcome barriers to dialogue and polarization.

Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The experts who participated in the workshops, were able to appropiate the insights and promote dialogue in difficult contexts in the sectors they are embeded in. A key example was a renowened economist sharing the results in workshops with leaders from the private sector. Also, the public institutions that face challenges due to polarization, particularly the General Secretariat of the Presidency and 60 other institutions in the executive were receptive of the results to guide internal decisions and public policy.

Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Check the answes to ""main obstacles"".

Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. Forecasting scenarios is useful for other topics, for example climate change adaptation.

How much the ""sense"" and ""explore"" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The sense phase was important to inform the experience of experts regarding effective ways to promote dialogue and polarization. The exploration phase was important to gather and analyze public opinon data and make sens of the results from the workshops. The experimentation phase was important to prototype adaptations of the methodlogy, design and implement the workshops.

What surprised you?

The learnings were surpricing. Also, it is somewhat surpricing that the drivers of polarization combined the balance between a provocation and the capacity to resist that provocation. Also, it was surpricing that experts from very different fields were able to relate to each other's experiences, and felt enthusiastic about furthering these exchanges."

What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any
It corresponds to our Artificial Intelligence and Democracy portfolio.

What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?
This activity addresses an increasingly prevalent challenge in the current context: political polarization, a multi-causal phenomenon whose deepening is a global trend. One of these causes is the use of algorithms aimed at promoting user interaction and participation on social networks. Algorithms tend to display content that aligns with users' beliefs, intensifying their negative feelings to encourage consumption. 

Furthermore, specifically in Argentine society, the sociopolitical context favors polarization between supporters of different political parties. In the context of the 40th anniversary of Argentine democracy, we use artificial intelligence tools, specifically natural language processing (NLP) through Chat GPT, to promote consensus and social cohesion. We emphasize what unites Argentine society beyond its political differences. To achieve this, we analyzed presidential inauguration and legislative session opening speeches from the last 40 years. We carry out an exercise that consists of three parts: discourse analysis, exploration of the topics addressed, and generation of a unified discourse from the corpus of analyzed texts. This tool can be generalized to

What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?
The learning question is: Can AI, through NLP tools, contribute to depolarization?  

When analyzing presidential speeches, to answer the learning question we can ask ourselves: Are there points of agreement and consensus in presidential speeches over the years that transcend partisan affiliations? Does the variation or continuity of themes converge over time?

Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:
Quasi experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity?
The specific learning intent of the activity is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) model to promote consensus and social cohesion through the analysis of political speeches. This model helps to create a common space for understanding and dialogue with the goal of addressing political polarization. In the context of the 40th anniversary of Argentina's democratic recovery, we use this tool to analyse and systematize presidential speeches from 1983 to the present. This activity encourages dialogue and underscores the importance of unity in a polarized context.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
This exercise consists of three sets of hypotheses: 

H1: The continuity of certain topics is positively related to the passage of time. 

H2: The continuity or variation of topics is unrelated to the president's party affiliation. 

H3: The continuity or variation of topics positively related to the context.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?
other

Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:
To assess our hypotheses, we employed Chat GPT to analyze themes in all presidential inaugural and legislative session opening speeches from the past 40 years, from the return of democracy to the present. The initial thematic analysis involved defining 30 themes using an associated word dictionary. Then, we queried Chat GPT to determine if each speech addressed these pre-defined themes.  

It's worth noting that due to AI character limitations, we had to segment and summarize each speech, creating an overall summary that consolidated these segments. ChatGPT can only operate with 4000 characters at a time, input (the question) and output (the answer) combined. Since most speeches exceed this number, they were divided into fragments of 2250 characters for analysis. Each of these fragments is then sent to ChatGPT with a prompt asking if that fragment addresses a particular topic (along with the definition of the topic) and, if so, ChatGPT is asked to copy exactly the specific part in which it appears. This action is repeated for each chunk and each of the topics. In this way, we obtain the topics addressed in all the fragments of each speech. From the identified themes in each speech, we examined the frequency of each theme per president over time, along with their associations with other themes and the specific words used in addressing them, among other aspects.

What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?
The unit of analysis is presidential speeches. The dataset consists of 52 inaugural and legislative session opening speeches delivered by 9 presidents over the course of 40 years of democracy.

Please describe the data collection technique proposed
To test our hypotheses, we needed text data. We obtained this information from presidential speeches, downloaded it from the national government's official website, and then processed this data through GPT Chat.

What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)
From May to November 2023, the project was carried out in several stages. In the first stage, from May to June, the model was developed, and data were collected from presidential speeches. In the second stage, from June to July, the information was processed. In the third stage, from July to December, these insights were used to write a report and publish an infographic on the topics of the speeches.

What is the estimated sample size?
50-99

What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
Between 10,000- and 20,000 USD

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?
The hypotheses were supported by observational, no experimental, data. We were able to test:  

H1 The continuity of certain topics is positively related to the passage of time: The hypothesis was partially supported. Continuity is observed over time in certain themes, such as ""macroeconomics,"" which was mentioned by all presidents. Other themes were predominantly addressed in different periods; for example, ""democracy"" was mentioned primarily in the post-military dictatorship period, and ""technology"" has been more prevalent in recent years. Additionally, some themes, though mentioned over time, have changed their connotation over the years. This is the case with ""democracy,"" which initially referred to the political system and, over time, was used to mention the ""democratization"" of certain rights. In conclusion, there is evidence of similarity in the themes addressed despite variations in their focus and conception over time. 

H2 The continuity or variation of topics is unrelated to the president's party affiliation: The hypothesis was confirmed; the variation or continuity of topics seems to depend more on the sociopolitical context than on the president's party affiliation. In other words, presidents from different parties but in similar contexts address similar topics. 

H3 The continuity or variation of topics positively related to the context: The hypothesis was confirmed; the mention of certain topics seems to depend, to a greater extent, on a temporal factor than on a partisan one. In other words, presidents from the same period address similar themes.

Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?
Regarding the methodology chosen to conduct the action, which involves analyzing speeches from various presidents over the last 40 years, it is crucial to address potential biases arising from the frequency with which different presidents spoke. For this reason, we opted to standardize the sample by selecting inauguration speeches and opening sessions of legislative sessions, as these must be delivered by all presidents. 

It is also important to consider biases inherent to the AI itself, particularly regarding text generation, as ChatGPT tends to converge to commonplaces and faces the potential presence of biases in the results due to the nature of the data it is trained on.

From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)
8 months.

What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)
For this activity, a total of $16,800 was invested. Of that amount, $4,400 was allocated to hiring the consultant who developed the NLP model, and $12,400 went to hiring the agency responsible for the project's identity design, including the website, report, and images for social media, among others.

Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain
This activity is part of the 'AI: Argentina Intelligence' project, which aims to explore and spread the uses, regulations, risks, and opportunities of artificial intelligence for development. Specifically, this activity focused on the use of AI for depolarization. Although this activity has concluded, we plan to continue exploring the opportunities that artificial intelligence can offer for development in future stages of the project.

Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?
No

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?
The main learning during this experiment is related to creation of the unified speech. The creation of the unified speech is more than the union of fragments from different texts. It requires identifying common themes, conjugating them, and creating a voice that maintains the style of the presidents. AI tools like ChatGPT add great value to this task, as they not only enable quantitative discourse analysis but can generate text within a context.

Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?
Our results highlight how AI tools can be utilized for the analysis and generation of political discourses, as well as for combating political polarization. This has the potential to benefit other areas within UNDP, both in terms of topic and methodology. The democratic governance area could benefit from the results due to the relevance of the topic, while other areas such as gender or environment could leverage the text analysis tool without necessarily being limited to governance topics or depolarization objectives

Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?
The results of this experiment could be beneficial for various sectors beyond UNDP. Firstly, both the Argentine government and public policy designers could directly benefit by obtaining key information to adapt governmental communication effectively. They could use the results as a valuable tool in seeking to reduce political polarization among different parties and exploring new avenues to achieve a more cohesive and unified society. 

Furthermore, it may favor other researchers and academics who adopt this method for analyzing discourses and trends over time. Additionally, political analysts could benefit from understanding how certain themes have evolved and converged in different presidential periods, regardless of party affiliation. This could provide valuable insights for the assessment and prediction of political dynamics.

Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?
No

What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?
The replicability of this exercise fundamentally depends on the availability of data. At this point, it is important to clarify that the texts to be analyzed must be faithful to the speeches, especially if they were delivered orally, as the choice of words and the way ideas are expressed are highly relevant for the analysis and generation of text.

Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?
This exercise has the potential to be replicated in various activities involving text or speech analysis, as well as text generation. For instance, it could be applied to other thematic areas such as Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, ""Good Health and Well-being,"" or SDG 5, ""Gender Equality."" Specifically, the experiment could be extended to analyze discourse surrounding gender equality policies and initiatives over the past decades. This would involve exploring how different stakeholders, including government officials, activists, and policymakers, have addressed issues such as gender-based violence and women's empowerment. The aim would be to study the progress made in these areas in recent years and, simultaneously, identify persistent challenges and emerging priorities in the pursuit of gender equality.

How much the ""sense"" and ""explore"" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?
This action was carried out in collaboration with the exploration area, as it is part of a larger project focused on exploring cutting-edge technology for both the Lab and the country, specifically artificial intelligence."

Design
Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.
What is the specific learning intent of the activity?
To understand how AI tools can enhance participatory urban planning processes, particularly in fostering increased social cohesion and generating innovative urban design solutions from diverse generational perspectives.

What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....
If we use AI tools to facilitate participatory urban planning workshops, then participants from different generations will engage more effectively in the planning process, increasing social cohesion and contributing diverse and valuable insights that lead to more inclusive and innovative urban design solutions.

Does the activity use a control group for comparison?
No, it does not use a control group

How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?
non-random assignment

Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:
Conduct Intergenerational Workshops: Organize a series of workshops involving participants from different age groups, including students from the Technological University of Panama and seniors citizens from the Betania community.

Utilize AI Tools: Use AI tools, such as UrbanistAI, to render participants' urban design ideas in real-time. This will facilitate visual understanding and help bridge generational communication gaps.

Facilitate Collaborative Design Sessions: Encourage participants to co-create urban space designs, using the AI-generated visuals as a common reference point. Facilitate discussions around these designs to capture diverse perspectives and ideas.

Collect Feedback and Observations: Gather qualitative and quantitative feedback from participants about their experiences using AI in the planning process. Observe interactions to assess levels of engagement and collaboration.

Analyze Social Cohesion Indicators: Assess indicators of social cohesion, such as mutual understanding, willingness to compromise, and shared goals, before and after the workshops.

Evaluate Urban Design Solutions: Analyze the quality and inclusivity of the urban design solutions generated, considering how well they reflect the input from all age groups.

Results
Only complete this section when presenting results
Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?
Proven

Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?
There are some limitations regarding the extend of the capacity of the AI to adequately render local contextual elements into the renders of the public spaces, a clear expression of that was that the AI used plants that usually don't grow in Panama´s weather

From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)
2 months

What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)
Around 2.5K which was to pay for the server capacity of UrbanistAI to render the images for the 4 workshops

Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain
Yes, we going to present the results of the design of the public spaces to the local government next month, for them to consider the elements into their urban planning

Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?
This has been brought up to the regional HDR team who has shown interest in publishing this experience into the regional Latam Human Development Report

Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

Learning
This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. 
What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?
The experiment demonstrated that integrating AI tools into participatory urban planning can significantly enhance engagement and inclusivity across generations. We learned that AI tools like UrbanistAI not only provide immediate visual feedback, which facilitates creative discussions, but also help bridge communication gaps between younger and older participants by offering a common, tangible reference point.

What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?
The main obstacles we encountered was using the AI platform, at some moment during the workshop the rendering of images would not be timely, and also sometimes the images would come out distorted. This shows that some challenges persist when using emerging technologies.

Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?
The results of this experimental activity are valuable for multiple UNDP teams, including the national and regional Human Development Report teams, as they provide practical insights into fostering social cohesion and inclusivity through participatory urban planning. The regional Human Development Report team has already recognized the significance of this experiment, indicating that it will be included in the upcoming regional report. Additionally, teams working on governance, digital transformation, and urban development can adapt these findings to enhance participatory processes and address community-level challenges, particularly in fostering trust and collaboration across generations. The governance team has also shown interest in using it in one of their programmes.

Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?
Outside UNDP, several stakeholders have directly benefited from this experiment. The Technological University of Panama, our key partner, gained valuable insights and practical experience from collaborating on this initiative, which they have integrated into one of their flagship programs aimed at bridging generational gaps through knowledge sharing. Additionally, the local government of Betania benefited from the final public space designs, which incorporated the perspectives of both elderly and young residents, providing them with actionable, community-driven solutions for urban improvement. These outcomes demonstrate the experiment’s potential to foster inclusive collaboration and generate sustainable development impacts beyond UNDP.

Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?
Yes, we did 4 workshops in total.

What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?
Test the tool first. Previous upload of pictures into the platform is recommended for faster editing process (it uses less server capacity this way).

Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?
Yes, this experiment can be replicated in other thematic areas and SDGs, such as SDG 13 (Climate Action) for community-driven climate resilience planning or SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) for designing inclusive health infrastructure. Key considerations include adapting the methodology to the specific context, ensuring stakeholder engagement in the targeted area, providing support for technological literacy, and allocating resources for facilitation and follow-up to maintain inclusivity and effectiveness.

What surprised you?
How much the use of technology can influence the level of engagement of youth."
