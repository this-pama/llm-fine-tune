EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that digital agricultural solutions are not effectively diffused in local contexts, limiting their impact on smallholder farmers. We need to understand what digital solutions exist, what digital skills farmers require, and how e-commerce platforms can enhance market access. Many digital solutions are developed without sufficient localization, making them less effective in specific farming communities

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Digital innovation in agriculture holds the potential to improve productivity, sustainability, and resilience. However, many solutions remain underutilized by smallholder farmers due to gaps in digital literacy, access to technology, and contextual relevance. Large-scale producers often have better access to these solutions, creating disparities. Additionally, local e-commerce platforms remain underdeveloped, limiting market access for farmers. Addressing these gaps is crucial to ensuring inclusive agricultural transformation.

There are some interesting analysis completed by Metamorphosis: 

(ref: https://metamorphosis.org.mk/en/aktivnosti_arhiva/farmers-need-literacy-training-rural-coalition/; https://metamorphosis.org.mk/en/blog/rural-coalition-farmers-still-hang-on-the-counters-the-application-of-digitalization-in-its-initial-stage/) 

Digital Literacy and E-Service Usage: A national report revealed that while 76% of farmers possess an email address and over 92% have stable internet connections, only 19% have utilized e-services.

Additionally, 64% prefer in-person interactions at service counters over electronic communication.

Digital Skills Gap: Despite 85% of rural households owning smartphones and having internet access, only 29% of farmers are proficient in internet and electronic communications, indicating a significant

digital skills gap.

 E-Commerce Adoption: While 92% of respondents have payment cards, only 26% pay bills electronically, and a mere 11% engage in online shopping, highlighting the underutilization of e-commerce platforms. E- commerce platforms remain underutilized, particularly at country level there are no specialized e-commerce sales for small farmers. 

The dataset generated by our team showcases a variety of digital solutions in agriculture: Solutions Platform.

In addition, we have noticed that large-scale producers adopt digital solutions much faster then the small farmers.



Weak signals observed:

- Smallholder farmers report difficulty in navigating digital tools, even when solutions are available.

- Many digital solutions are developed without sufficient localization, making them less effective in specific farming communities.

- Interviews suggest that farmers are hesitant to adopt e-commerce due to trust issues, lack of digital payment access, and logistical concerns.

According to the analysis conducted by Metamorphosis these are these are some of the highlights: 

1. Trust and Familiarity Issues: Many farmers have email addresses but often forget passwords or leave accounts inactive, leading to reliance on in-person services. This indicates a lack of trust and familiarity with digital tools.

2. Preference for Traditional Methods: Despite having access to digital tools, a significant number of farmers prefer traditional methods of communication and service acquisition, suggesting resistance to digital adoption. 

3. Awareness and Accessibility: Over 52% of farmers are unaware of the national e-services portal (www.uslugi.gov.mk), and among those informed, only 18% have accessed it, often requiring assistance, indicating barriers in awareness and accessibility.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The UNDP Accelerator Lab brings a unique value proposition by applying an action-learning approach to uncover how digital agricultural solutions can be effectively localized in North Macedonia. Our Lab has recruited the help of UNVs and currently is working analyzing further the solutions identifying areas for  experimenting, identify enablers and barriers, and support the program colleagues to co-create interventions with farmers, policymakers, and tech developers. This work complements broader UNDP initiatives by focusing on the diffusion of innovation rather than solely solution development. Investing in this challenge ensures that digital transformation in agriculture is inclusive and sustainable.

Challenge statement
null
Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
BIG BET

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that FGM in Guinea-Bissau is directly linked to cultural and religious norms and practices, negatively affecting women and girls health and leading to direct and indirect forms of GBV affecting their overall integration and participation in society. This is particularly prominent in regions such as Gabu, Bafatá and Quinara, but its a problem widespread across the national territory. Additionally, the political class avoids this area for fear of losing votes and popular support from masses, causing this problem to become even more normalised.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
- Girls and women from rural areas, with less education or who identify as Muslim are at greater risk of FGM.

- Guinea-Bissau is a society of mouth-to-mouth tradition passing, which means that FGM is seen a cultural and religious tradition passed on through generations. 

- Traditional circumciser (Fanatecas; women who practice FGM; usually women of age) 98%, Traditional birth attendant 2% and Other traditional practitioner 0.1%

- Over 400,000 girls and women in Guinea-Bissau alive today have experienced FGM. Overall, 52 per cent of girls and

women aged 15 to 49 years have undergone the practice, varying from 96 per cent in Gabu region to 8 per cent in Biombo

- This practice affects women's and girls' health and leading to direct and indirect forms of GBV affecting their overall integration and participation in society (access to education, early marriage, access to health, justice etc)



- Social and cultural pressure to maintain the practice.

- Perception that FGM guarantees purity and facilitates marriage.

- Low knowledge about the risks and illegality of the practice (Law 14/2011).

- Influence of religious and cultural leaders who support FGM.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The unique value proposition that the Lab in Guinea-Bissau is bringing is through the use of innovative methodologies to look at ways in which the challenge can be overcome through the use of new technologies to achieve different results. Particularly coming from the principle that widening the search for a solution to different communities and groups, might create a space to try new ways to target the problem of FGM in the country such as ethnography and crowdsourcing.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
In Guinea-Bissau, the UNDP Accelerator Lab is using innovation, tech &amp; community-driven methods like ethnography &amp; crowdsourcing to tackle FGM differently, expanding the search for solutions beyond the usual. #EndFGM

Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?
Collective Intelligence &amp; Partnerships - these methods will support us in understand, what has been done, what has worked and not worked and how we can try different solution in order to achieve new positive results. 


Crowdsourcing &amp; Solutions Mapping - This will allow this to use new technologies to understand the issue from different perspectives including those of people outside of these affected communities as well as map solutions in order to find sustainability. 


Reverse Engineering - Instead of taking the traditional route, we will crowdsource first, to find solutions and only after do the system thinking workshop to discuss potential solutions with key partners.

The Red Integral de Mercados Municipales Urbanos (RIMMU) is the third-largest source of organic waste in Panama City, where over 2,500 tons of waste are generated daily—50% of which is organic. This situation is compounded by inefficient waste management systems, lack of infrastructure for composting and food rescue, low levels of environmental awareness, and fragmented governance.\nRecognizing this challenge, UNDP and FAO jointly secured a $250,000 award from the SDG Fund to address this issue through a systemic and cross-sectoral initiative. This collaboration seeks to transform waste management in five public markets using circular economy principles, while also promoting inclusive governance, innovation, and behavior change.\nThe initiative strategically integrates a portfolio of experiments across different intervention areas to collectively test what works in building a sustainable model. These experiments include: testing composting models, piloting food rescue programs, activating placemaking for behavior change, co-developing a digital dashboard system for waste management, and launching communication campaigns for environmental awareness. Each experiment is designed to feed learning and adaptation into the others, allowing for real-time iteration and systemic integration.\nThe initiative is grounded in multi-actor coordination involving local government (Dirección de Mercados Municipales), civil society (Fundación Rescate de Alimentos), academia (Smithsonian Institute), and the private sector (Bliss). It aims to reduce organic waste sent to landfills, improve food security, generate compost, and activate markets as sustainable public spaces. However, the current situation still shows disjointed efforts, weak policy incentives, data silos, and limited community ownership—leading to missed opportunities for economic value recovery, worsening climate impacts, and continued citizen disengagement from public market governance.\n\n\n"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that Panama’s municipal markets are significant generators of organic waste, yet they lack the systems, incentives, and behavioral change mechanisms necessary to transition towards a sustainable circular economy model that reduces waste, promotes food security, and strengthens community participation.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Panama’s municipal markets are critical public infrastructures that serve as economic, social, and cultural hubs—but they are also major contributors to the city’s organic waste crisis. The Red Integral de Mercados Municipales Urbanos (RIMMU) is the third-largest source of organic waste in Panama City, where over 2,500 tons of waste are generated daily—50% of which is organic. This situation is compounded by inefficient waste management systems, lack of infrastructure for composting and food rescue, low levels of environmental awareness, and fragmented governance.
Recognizing this challenge, UNDP and FAO jointly secured a $250,000 award from the SDG Fund to address this issue through a systemic and cross-sectoral initiative. This collaboration seeks to transform waste management in five public markets using circular economy principles, while also promoting inclusive governance, innovation, and behavior change.
The initiative strategically integrates a portfolio of experiments across different intervention areas to collectively test what works in building a sustainable model. These experiments include: testing composting models, piloting food rescue programs, activating placemaking for behavior change, co-developing a digital dashboard system for waste management, and launching communication campaigns for environmental awareness. Each experiment is designed to feed learning and adaptation into the others, allowing for real-time iteration and systemic integration.
The initiative is grounded in multi-actor coordination involving local government (Dirección de Mercados Municipales), civil society (Fundación Rescate de Alimentos), academia (Smithsonian Institute), and the private sector (Bliss). It aims to reduce organic waste sent to landfills, improve food security, generate compost, and activate markets as sustainable public spaces. However, the current situation still shows disjointed efforts, weak policy incentives, data silos, and limited community ownership—leading to missed opportunities for economic value recovery, worsening climate impacts, and continued citizen disengagement from public market governance.

2,500 tons of waste are generated daily in Panama; 50% is organic.

The RIMMU is the third-largest source of mostly organic waste.

5.6% of Panama’s population (approx. 200,000 people) face food insecurity.

71.1% of adults suffer from diet-related diseases.

Target: Reduce landfill waste by 10%, and produce 150 kg of compost monthly.



Behavioral resistance and lack of incentives for composting and sorting at source observed in stakeholder engagement sessions.

Informal feedback from vendors shows interest in participating in food rescue and composting if solutions are practical, low-cost, and profitable.

Weak signals of change: increased social media traction around sustainable markets; rising consumer interest in local food, sustainable gastronomy, and cleaner public spaces.

Pilot activities show growing willingness to co-create solutions.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The Accelerator Lab offers a unique capacity to prototype circular economy solutions through a sandbox approach and a systemic integration of a portfolio of experiments, combining:

- Behavior change campaigns,

 - Participatory placemaking,

 - Environmental storytelling,

 - Experimentation with composting and food rescue,

 - Data system development and real-time dashboards.

Our Lab’s strength lies in the trust we have built with our partners during our previous work in public markets, which allows us to test assumptions rapidly, foster cross-sectoral partnerships, and generate actionable learnings that can be scaled. Through the systemic integration of multiple experiments, we are able to explore complementary entry points into the challenge and build a more robust and scalable transformation pathway.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
Panama’s markets generate tons of organic waste daily. We’re testing circular economy pilots—composting, food rescue, and placemaking—to turn waste into value and markets into sustainable community hubs. #SDGs #CircularEconomy #Innovation

Regarding the total territory in the state of Queretaro, the percentages of areas affected by a particular type of drought are distributed as follows, as shown in the image of the map of Mexico:\n\n0.0% Unaffected\n\n3.8% D0 Abnormally dry\n\n17.6% D1 Moderate drought\n\n15.3% D2 Severe drought\n\n27.2% D3 Extreme drought\n\n36.1% D4 Exceptional drought\n\nThis means that a bit more than 60% of the state suffer from the highest types of droughts as of June 2024. \n\nFurthermore, out of the 18 municipalities in Queretaro, one is experiencing moderate drought, two severe drought, four extreme drought, and eleven exceptional drought, which is the highest form of drought. These numbers show the vulnerability of the state with regards to access to water, illustrating the urgency of tackling this challenge. [1]\n\nAccording to the Water Information System Monitoring of Mexico’s Major Dams, as of July 2024, Queretaro has 7 damns, 4 of them have reservoir levels of less than 10%, 2 damns have between 11 and 15% and only 1 has a reservoir level of 90%. [2]\n\nWater scarcity in Queretaro has been exacerbated by population growth and an increase in housing. Queretaro stands out due to its economic and industrial development, ranking 5th place on a national level in terms of competitiveness [3]. Due to the competitive job market in the state, in the past years, many people have settled in Queretaro.\n\nComparing the Population and Housing Census of 2010 with that of 2020, the number of households increased by 63.45%, and the population by 47.9%. The number of households increased to a greater extent. One house was built for every 2.37 inhabitants, as shown in the image with the visualization of statistics. [4]\n\nAccording to the 2022 National Survey of Household Income and Expenditures (ENIGH), 68.22% of the population in Queretaro has access to piped water and sanitation, and 68.46% have access to safely sourced drinking water and sanitation services.\n\nIn this context of water scarcity, population growth and urban development, it is important to address the issue of granting feasibilities for new connections to the hydraulic network in a more sustainable way and based on long-term planning.\n\n \n\nSources: \n\n[1]https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/tools/DATA/Climatolog%C3%ADa/Sequ%C3%ADa/Monitor%20de%20sequ%C3%ADa%20en%20M%C3%A9xico/Seguimiento%20de%20Sequ%C3%ADa/MSM20240630.pdf\n\n[2] https://sinav30.conagua.gob.mx:8080/Presas/\n\n[3] https://www.liderempresarial.com/desafio-y-realidad-el-panorama-hidrico-y-energetico-en-queretaro/\n\n[4] https://observatoriodeciudades.mx/blog/vivienda-y-expansion-urbana-el-caso-de-queretaro/"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""9ca8bdba-cf1b-48fd-872f-b019d0d5fb74"", ""src"": null, ""html"": """", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""left"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""91cb1034-8f74-4c54-b42a-11a63643d7b3"", ""name"": null, ""srcs"": [""uploads/34924aa8-fcba-4efd-9c4c-4991760f8e66/2f3971ce90d7aaaf76be5143cd657217.png"", ""uploads/34924aa8-fcba-4efd-9c4c-4991760f8e66/ddcbed218d29c67d381a44404e277965.png""], ""type"": ""mosaic"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """", ""verticalalign"": ""center""}]], ""level"": ""media"", ""structure"": [{""id"": ""45c2f1c7-0640-4562-89b5-c541ae3e8a56"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""is_excerpt"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""9ca8bdba-cf1b-48fd-872f-b019d0d5fb74"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""5b0edd22-f7cc-4d9c-9f6b-2ac95cf86bae"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}], ""instruction"": ""Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge?

We share the signals we identified below.\n\n \n\nA)    SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES\n\nDams are alarmingly empty:\n\nDue to the water crisis, Queretaro has become the third state in the country with the most dams that do not exceed 30% of their capacity. Back in May 2024, it was reported that  El Centenario, La Llave, and La Venta dams were completely empty [1].\n\nTwo of the other four dams in the region barely exceeded this, as they were holding less than 5% of their total capacity.\n\nThis signal illustrates the urgency of contributing to the management of water resources in the state.\n\nThe privatization of water:\n\nThere are 23 concessions granted by the State Water Commission of Queretaro to private companies, including real estate firms for urban housing and commercial developments. Among the main concessionaires are Operadora Querétaro Moderno and Fraccionamientos Selectos I. This situation leads to discontent among the population, many of them complain about excessive prices in the water service [2] [3].\n\nThis highlights the dynamics of water in the state between private and public sectors, inviting us to think how the feasibilities process could contribute to a better planning of water resources in the future, and better decision making when it comes to deciding if the provision of water should be a private or public enterprise.\n\nThe impact of water scarcity in productive activities:\n\nSmall and medium-sized producers working in the primary sector, such as agriculture, livestock, or fishing, have seen their productivity decline due to the effects of the drought. Aquaculture producers blame low water levels for limiting fish farming. Aquaculturists in the region point out that several of their colleagues have migrated to the United States due to the income drop caused by these conditions.\n\nAdditionally, agricultural and livestock producers have also experienced reduced production due to low reservoir levels. Even if it rains, there is inadequate infrastructure for water capturing. [4] [5]\n\nThis situation showcases how various sectors are being affected by the water crisis and invites us to think how the feasibility procedure for new water connections for housing and commercial use could be managed in a more sustainable way in order to ensure access to water in the future not only for new constructions, but also for productive activities.\n\nAnother signal that illustrates this situation is related to the fact that Queretaro has become a hub for investment with the arrival of several data centers. However, it is anticipated that in the long term, energy demands may not be met. This is exacerbated by bureaucratic procedures, as companies often lack information about how the energy they use is generated. And in addition to energy, access to water to operate the data centers will also put great pressure on the water resources of the state.\n\n \n\nSocial response to government’s actions around water management:\n\nGrassroots organizations and indigenous collectives in the region are actively involved in addressing various issues, which are highlighted below:\n\n-Due to the \""land use change voted by the council allowing 66,641 square meters settled in the area, 409 apartments will be built in four-story buildings, where a mall and services will be integrated\"" in the El Batán area, favoring real estate interests, environmental groups seek to designate several areas as protected zones [6].\n\n-The Museo del Agua Bajo Tierra has published reports on the privatization of water in Querétaro and criticizes the \""Ley Kuri,\"" or concessions law, which regulates the provision of drinking water, sewage, and sanitation services, as well as unplanned real estate growth and overexploitation of water in urban areas.\n\n  -In 2022, the Caravana por la Vida mobilized several of these groups to the Otomí region in Santiago Mexquititlan and took over a well as a form of protest against excessive charges and the criminalization of activists. The Indigenous Council of Santiago Mexquititlán \""also commemorated their own struggle, which began on March 31, 2021, against what they described as an attempt to dispossess their community of their well with water pipes owned by a private companies protected by state police,\"" expressing concerns about the management of a well by the State’s Water Commission, which they affirm was built by their ancestors [7].\n\nThe examples presented above show some of the dynamics and challenges that surround the management of water resources and its linkage with land use. This highlights the involvement of various sectors in the issue, which invites us to think about possible links with their involvement in the creation of a feasibilities procedure focused on planning.\n\nB)    USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR\n\n Since the surge of generative AI, its adoption in the public sector has generated examples of how this technology can improve the way governments operate. And while the examples are relatively new and scarce, this technology has the potential to enhance —and even transform— the way governments operate. As shown in the image, some of the trends of using generative AI include improve speed and efficiency of public services and engagement, optimize employee time by reducing manual processes, draw insights to empower decision-makers, etc. [8].\n\nOn the other hand, the huge impact that AI systems can have in various domains of our lives call for a critical, thoughtful, imaginative and cautious approach to designing AI strategies.\n\nAs Vaugh Tan frames it: “To have good AI strategy, we need to make reasoned decisions about:\n\n1.     What humans can do which AI systems cannot — these are tasks which should be done by humans.\n\n2.     What AI systems can do much better than humans — these are tasks which AI systems should be built to do.” [9]\n\nThis becomes particularly urgent in the context of public services because these systems need to ensure human-rights, inclusion, ethics, transparency. Thus, it becomes imperative that we define pathways to design good AI strategies for deploying these systems in the public sector.\n\n \n\n \n\nSources:\n\n[1] https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/Principales-presas-de-Queretaro-estan-a-3.1-de-almacenamiento-20240514-0057.html\n\n[2] https://www.jornada.com.mx/noticia/2024/01/26/estados/oligopolio-del-agua-socio-de-inmobiliarias-en-queretaro-3791\n\n[3] https://tribunadequeretaro.com/informacion/investigaciones/ley-de-aguas-dan-concesion-disfrazada-corregidora-ya-serian-23-en-queretaro/\n\n[4] https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/Productores-agropecuarios-de-Queretaro-alertan-por-grave-crisis-de-sequia-y-escasez-de-agua-20240311-0083.html\n\n[5] https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/Sequia-afecta-a-96-de-las-perdidas-de-produccion-agropecuaria-en-Queretaro-20240319-0076.html\n\n[6] https://noticiasdequeretaro.com.mx/2020/07/15/lamentan-activistas-cambio-de-uso-de-suelo-en-el-batan/\n\n[7] https://losangelespress.org/mexico-de-conciencia/indigenas-en-defensa-del-agua-contra-represion-en-queretaro-20240610-8677.html\n\n[8] https://wwps.microsoft.com/blog/services-ai-apolitical\n\n[9] https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/where-ai-wins"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""aea972c1-0eb8-4b0b-87cf-fb394c246bf8"", ""src"": null, ""html"": """", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""left"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""6fca277f-9fb1-428a-b2f1-91cd42f51981"", ""src"": ""uploads/34924aa8-fcba-4efd-9c4c-4991760f8e66/a324409745247dd590be686b68515e8e.png"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""scale"": ""original"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""center"", ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}]], ""level"": ""media"", ""structure"": [{""id"": ""ac86f88e-6d60-432b-828f-b849c40a7b2d"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""is_excerpt"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""aea972c1-0eb8-4b0b-87cf-fb394c246bf8"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""6fca277f-9fb1-428a-b2f1-91cd42f51981"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}], ""instruction"": ""Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency?

Learning by Testing: Generative AI for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning
Challenge statement
null
Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
BIG BET

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is how public officials can leverage generative artificial intelligence tools to review and analyze applications for new connections to the water network, in order to improve the agility and accuracy of the feasibility process with anticipatory capacity*.

 

*Note: Agility and accuracy refer, for example, to improving the cross-referencing of information, analysis, and decision-making between silos (i.e., the internal areas of the State Water Commission responsible for conducting technical analyses to determine the feasibility of a new application). Anticipatory capacity can be applied, for instance, to planning hydraulic infrastructure or adjusting requirements for new developments.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
NOTE: This Action Plan continues AccLab Mexico’s research and development efforts in water management and generative artificial intelligence, as first outlined in our previous Action Plan: “Promoting water sustainability with generative AI: Transforming the feasibilities procedure into a planning tool for water resources management” (go to: https://sdg-innovation-commons.org/pads/action%20plan/2349). In this new Action Plan, we focus on a deeper understanding of the feasibility procedure and on piloting a concrete solution.  




The framing of our current challenge emerged from our previous efforts with the Water Commission to enhance the process for evaluating new water service connections in Querétaro. While the current feasibility analysis provides valuable information, several areas of opportunity for improving the analysis have been identified. Estimating water availability and future demand remains complex due to fragmented and outdated data, limited analytical tools, and coordination challenges across departments and institutions. Additionally, the ability to anticipate and respond to climate variability is constrained by the absence of integrated scenario planning tools. Internally, information silos and the lack of standardized mechanisms for data sharing can delay decision-making. These conditions contribute to a reactive planning environment, instead of a more strategic future-oriented one.

Water scarcity is a big issue in Mexico, including the state of Queretaro. Regarding the total territory in the state of Queretaro, the percentages of areas affected by a particular type of drought are distributed as follows, as shown in the image of the map of Mexico:

0.0% Unaffected

3.8% D0 Abnormally dry

17.6% D1 Moderate drought

15.3% D2 Severe drought

27.2% D3 Extreme drought

36.1% D4 Exceptional drought

This means that a bit more than 60% of the state suffer from the highest types of droughts as of June 2024. 

Furthermore, out of the 18 municipalities in Queretaro, one is experiencing moderate drought, two severe drought, four extreme drought, and eleven exceptional drought, which is the highest form of drought. These numbers show the vulnerability of the state with regards to access to water, illustrating the urgency of tackling this challenge. [1]

According to the Water Information System Monitoring of Mexico’s Major Dams, as of July 2024, Queretaro has 7 damns, 4 of them have reservoir levels of less than 10%, 2 damns have between 11 and 15% and only 1 has a reservoir level of 90%. [2]

Water scarcity in Queretaro has been exacerbated by population growth and an increase in housing. Queretaro stands out due to its economic and industrial development, ranking 5th place on a national level in terms of competitiveness [3]. Due to the competitive job market in the state, in the past years, many people have settled in Queretaro.

Comparing the Population and Housing Census of 2010 with that of 2020, the number of households increased by 63.45%, and the population by 47.9%. The number of households increased to a greater extent. One house was built for every 2.37 inhabitants, as shown in the image with the visualization of statistics. [4]

According to the 2022 National Survey of Household Income and Expenditures (ENIGH), 68.22% of the population in Queretaro has access to piped water and sanitation, and 68.46% have access to safely sourced drinking water and sanitation services.

In this context of water scarcity, population growth and urban development, it is important to address the issue of granting feasibilities for new connections to the hydraulic network in a more sustainable way and based on long-term planning.

We have identified signals in two high level domains: sustainable management of water resources and the use of generative AI in the public sector. We share the signals we identified below.

 

A)    SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

Dams are alarmingly empty:

Due to the water crisis, Queretaro has become the third state in the country with the most dams that do not exceed 30% of their capacity. Back in May 2024, it was reported that  El Centenario, La Llave, and La Venta dams were completely empty [1].

Two of the other four dams in the region barely exceeded this, as they were holding less than 5% of their total capacity.

This signal illustrates the urgency of contributing to the management of water resources in the state.

The privatization of water:

There are 23 concessions granted by the State Water Commission of Queretaro to private companies, including real estate firms for urban housing and commercial developments. Among the main concessionaires are Operadora Querétaro Moderno and Fraccionamientos Selectos I. This situation leads to discontent among the population, many of them complain about excessive prices in the water service [2] [3].

This highlights the dynamics of water in the state between private and public sectors, inviting us to think how the feasibilities process could contribute to a better planning of water resources in the future, and better decision making when it comes to deciding if the provision of water should be a private or public enterprise.

The impact of water scarcity in productive activities:

Small and medium-sized producers working in the primary sector, such as agriculture, livestock, or fishing, have seen their productivity decline due to the effects of the drought. Aquaculture producers blame low water levels for limiting fish farming. Aquaculturists in the region point out that several of their colleagues have migrated to the United States due to the income drop caused by these conditions.

Additionally, agricultural and livestock producers have also experienced reduced production due to low reservoir levels. Even if it rains, there is inadequate infrastructure for water capturing. [4] [5]

This situation showcases how various sectors are being affected by the water crisis and invites us to think how the feasibility procedure for new water connections for housing and commercial use could be managed in a more sustainable way in order to ensure access to water in the future not only for new constructions, but also for productive activities.

Another signal that illustrates this situation is related to the fact that Queretaro has become a hub for investment with the arrival of several data centers. However, it is anticipated that in the long term, energy demands may not be met. This is exacerbated by bureaucratic procedures, as companies often lack information about how the energy they use is generated. And in addition to energy, access to water to operate the data centers will also put great pressure on the water resources of the state.

 

Social response to government’s actions around water management:

Grassroots organizations and indigenous collectives in the region are actively involved in addressing various issues, which are highlighted below:

-Due to the ""land use change voted by the council allowing 66,641 square meters settled in the area, 409 apartments will be built in four-story buildings, where a mall and services will be integrated"" in the El Batán area, favoring real estate interests, environmental groups seek to designate several areas as protected zones [6].

-The Museo del Agua Bajo Tierra has published reports on the privatization of water in Querétaro and criticizes the ""Ley Kuri,"" or concessions law, which regulates the provision of drinking water, sewage, and sanitation services, as well as unplanned real estate growth and overexploitation of water in urban areas.

  -In 2022, the Caravana por la Vida mobilized several of these groups to the Otomí region in Santiago Mexquititlan and took over a well as a form of protest against excessive charges and the criminalization of activists. The Indigenous Council of Santiago Mexquititlán ""also commemorated their own struggle, which began on March 31, 2021, against what they described as an attempt to dispossess their community of their well with water pipes owned by a private companies protected by state police,"" expressing concerns about the management of a well by the State’s Water Commission, which they affirm was built by their ancestors [7].

The examples presented above show some of the dynamics and challenges that surround the management of water resources and its linkage with land use. This highlights the involvement of various sectors in the issue, which invites us to think about possible links with their involvement in the creation of a feasibilities procedure focused on planning.

B)    USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR

 Since the surge of generative AI, its adoption in the public sector has generated examples of how this technology can improve the way governments operate. And while the examples are relatively new and scarce, this technology has the potential to enhance —and even transform— the way governments operate. As shown in the image, some of the trends of using generative AI include improve speed and efficiency of public services and engagement, optimize employee time by reducing manual processes, draw insights to empower decision-makers, etc. [8].

On the other hand, the huge impact that AI systems can have in various domains of our lives call for a critical, thoughtful, imaginative and cautious approach to designing AI strategies.

As Vaugh Tan frames it: “To have good AI strategy, we need to make reasoned decisions about:

1.     What humans can do which AI systems cannot — these are tasks which should be done by humans.

2.     What AI systems can do much better than humans — these are tasks which AI systems should be built to do.” [9]

This becomes particularly urgent in the context of public services because these systems need to ensure human-rights, inclusion, ethics, transparency. Thus, it becomes imperative that we define pathways to design good AI strategies for deploying these systems in the public sector.

Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The Accelerator Lab adds unique value by operating in a practice-oriented, experimental mode—designing and testing proof-of-concept solutions in real-world conditions. Building on prior systemic analysis, the Lab will apply agile methodologies to prototype a AI tool and generate rapid learnings to inform future iterations. This approach enables low-risk exploration of innovative pathways and supports public institutions in making more informed, data-driven decisions.

 At the same time, the Lab’s convening power and participatory methods foster collaboration across institutional and sectoral boundaries. In a context where UNDP Mexico is still building its profile in AI and digitalization, this work positions the Country Office as a credible partner for inclusive and sustainable tech adoption. The Lab’s connection to a global learning network further amplifies its impact, allowing it to share insights and draw from international experiences.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
AccLab Mexico is exploring how generative AI can help public officials review water connection requests more efficiently—boosting accuracy, breaking silos, and enabling anticipatory planning for sustainable water infrastructure.

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Nuestro reto es el de llevar a los territorios de Colombia la metodología de Mapeo de Soluciones, con un ciclo de actividades validado el semestre pasado (2024), para de esta manera, al mapear las soluciones existentes y articular a los actores de diversos ecosistemas territoriales ( academia, innovación, gubernamental), se pueden diseñar intervenciones más inteligentes y efectivas para reducir las brechas territoriales, ya sea escalando una solución local exitosa o conectándola con recursos que antes no tenía. El ciclo de implementación de la territorialización de Mapeo de Soluciones, consta de las siguientes actividades: 

1. Bootcamp de Mapeo de Soluciones

2. Mapeo de Soluciones 

3. Intercambio de Saberes 

4. Constitución de una Comunidad de Mapeo de Soluciones territoriales (Opcional) 

5. Construcción conjunta de Hoja de Ruta para la Gobernanza Territorial de la Comunidad de Mapeo de Soluciones 

6. Articulación de Acciones para el cierre de brechas (Gobierno, Cooperación Internacional, Academia, Sociedad Civil)

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
La definición de Mapeo de Soluciones surge desde la identificación de soluciones que se desarrollan para enfrentar desafíos del desarrollo, que no han sido abordados por el Estado y/o el mercado. Al implementar el ciclo descrito en el enunciado del reto, en dos departamentos de Colombia, encontramos una oportunidad al vincular los solucionadores con representantes de la academia y el gobierno, conectando diálogos que antes habían sido poco o nada probables, conectando la potencia de sus propuestas con la misionalidad de estas instancias. Estas interacciones se desarrollaron en espacios de encuentro presenciales en los que los solucionadores (as) presentaron sus propuestas y sus historias de vida, para conectar de manera genuina con el ecosistema de innovación de cada uno de los departamentos. De esta experiencia se cuenta entonces con la articulación que actualmente se está gestionando con instancias como: 

-Ministerio de Agricultura- Dirección de Mujer Rural: Al presentar a este ministerio el trabajo realizado desde Mapeo de Soluciones en el departamento de Cauca y Meta, se acordaron las siguientes acciones : 

- Participación activa del Ministerio de Agricultura en la Comunidad de Mapeo de Soluciones, desde la aplicación de la oferta institucional con la Federación de Campesinos del Cauca. Con esta iniciativa se apalanca la Política de Género de esta asociación, llevando a territorio toda la oferta institucional a 533 mujeres del Cauca (asociatividad, proyectos, finanzas, entre otras). 

-Articulación con el SENA Cauca ( Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje), con la oferta institucional de este organismo gubernamental ( Investigación y desarrollo, emprendimiento, fomento y capacitación) dado que la Comunidad de Mapeo de Soluciones del Cauca, les permite llevar esta oferta a una zona en la que no había logrado llevar a cabo sus dos líneas de trabajo SENACampo y Economía Popular. De esta manera la comunidad, se convierte en una posibilidad para iniciar su trabajo en esta zona del país y cumplir su mandato.

En el marco del Programa Corredores de Paz, financiado por

la Embajada de Suecia en Colombia, se implementó desde octubre de 2024 la Estrategia

de Mapeo de Soluciones. Esta iniciativa surge como respuesta a las

profundas desigualdades territoriales que caracterizan a los departamentos del

Cauca y Meta, territorios que enfrentan complejos desafíos sociales, económicos

y de seguridad:

1.1 Panorama Social del Cauca

El departamento del Cauca presenta uno de los panoramas

sociales más críticos del país:

Pobreza estructural: Se encuentra entre los departamentos con mayor pobreza

Monetaria nacional, superando significativamente el promedio de pobreza.

multidimensional del país (11,5% en 2024)

Crisis humanitaria: Durante 2024 se registraron 43 emergencias humanitarias 

por desplazamiento masivo y confinamiento, afectando a casi 40.000

personas de comunidades indígenas, afrodescendientes y campesinas (OCAH,

2024)

Violencia sistemática: Se reportaron 61 muertes violentas de mujeres y 11

masacres que resultaron en 45 personas asesinadas

Dinámicas migratorias: La migración departamental alcanzó el 8.9%, distribuida

en 36% intramunicipal y 64% intermunicipal

1.2 Realidad Socioeconómica del Meta

El departamento del Meta evidencia marcadas disparidades

territoriales:

Pobreza diferenciada: La pobreza rural multidimensional (20,3% en 2022)

duplica la urbana (8.5%), reflejando profundas inequidades territoriales

Mercado laboral: Tasa de desempleo del 9.1% (mayo 2025), en particular

afectación en zonas rurales

2729,"Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy: Closure","[{""id"": ""087baaef-acc5-4c1e-a89e-3e168275a268"", ""lead"": """", ""type"": ""section"", ""items"": [{""id"": ""7b0dfc60-0d60-4e6a-b271-cf65e4e2aab5"", ""txt"": ""We worked with government and the Barbados Museum &amp; Historical Society on hosting the A.I. Symposium on Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage. Based on this event which included 6 panels of subject matter experts, we gathered the following insights:\n\n1) The Double-Edged Sword of A.I.\n\nSeveral panelists noted the many benefits that A.I. can bring to the Orange Economy in the Caribbean, including democratizing access to cultural heritage, enhancing arts education capacities and opening new markets for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Many of these positive shifts are already being seen, even if on a small scale. On the flipside, numerous risks were noted - with the potential for A.I. to exacerbate inequalities, further entrench biases, and threaten cultural diversity. From a security standpoint, ethical concerns around data use, privacy, and intellectual property were frequently raised. This resulted in a double-edged sword dynamic requiring proper stewardship to ensure the safe usage of A.I. for creative purposes. \n\n2) Ethics, Equity and Human Rights\n\nMany emphasized that any application of A.I. in the arts sector should be firmly rooted in an ethical framework based on human dignity, cultural specificity, and inclusivity. This included calls for a transparent, fair and rights-based approach to A.I. regulation. Additionally, given that A.I. tools are often consumed rather than produced in the Caribbean, it was recognized that A.I. must be anchored in local values rather than those imported externally from global tech hubs. This reflects the reality that dominant A.I. systems typically include Western biases and exclude Caribbean perspectives. As such, there is a need to train A.I. on regional data while also making efforts to protect that data from misuse.\n\n3) Governance Gaps and the Demand for Regional Strategy\n\nIn Barbados and among the wider Caribbean, A.I. policies are under development, especially when it comes to the creative industries where issues such as deepfakes, voice cloning and unauthorized use of likenesses are prevalent. In this process, there is the distinct challenge of keeping up with the fast speed of A.I. technologies, which are constantly evolving. To address this nascent governance field, regional collaboration was recommended with emphasis on solutions co-designed with grassroots communities, artists, technologists and policymakers alongside institutions such as UNDP, BMHS and ICOM as key partners. This Caribbean-wide approach could together address A.I. policy, digital infrastructure and cultural preservation.\n\n4) A.I. and the Orange Economy\n\nThe Orange Economy, encompassing economic activities derived from creativity, culture and innovation, is home to specific complexities when it comes to A.I., such as the requirement for protection of intellectual property in music, film, and literature. Several artists underscored the importance of understanding digital ownership, authorship and authentication in the age of A.I., resulting in a strong demand for digital rights and policies that prioritize creators. Additionally, fair compensation for creatives was mentioned and tied to the devaluation of art forms that could occur through A.I., as well as the risks of job displacement posed by emerging tools in graphic design, sound production and editing.\n\n5) Education and Digital Capacity Building  \n\nThe Government of Barbados is integrating digital capacity-building efforts into the classroom, seen in coding, digital literacy and civics in the curriculum. These efforts are ultimately preparing students for a future deeply impacted by A.I. At the same time, arts education is focusing on critical thinking, responsible technology use and empowering youth to be active creators rather than passive consumers. This also connects to instilling a sense of integrity and ownership among art producers in the A.I. landscape.\n\n6) A.I. and Heritage Preservation\n\nGlobally in the heritage field, A.I. is being used to digitize heritage-based archives, enhance metadata creation and support conservation. The digitization of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), which includes language, rituals, crafts and oral traditions, is a bit more complex, however, as these elements are harder to digitize and protect. Panelists found that A.I. can help document ICH, but that the fundamentals of trust, consent and cultural sensitivity must be established first. To best future-proof these efforts, the significance of open-source tools, distributed storage and non-proprietary formats for sustainability purposes were voiced.\n\n7) Gender, LGBTQIA+ Rights &amp; Digital Safety  \n\nDepending on its use, A.I. can amplify marginalized voices or reinforce systemic biases, thus necessitating a stringent approach to regulation and oversight. Concerns around automated harassment, surveillance, and data exploitation were raised. To mitigate these potential pitfalls, panelists recommended intersectionality, community-led safeguards and inclusive data practices in A.I. \n\n8) A.I. in Archaeology &amp; Heritage Preservation\n\nIn archaeology, history is meeting modern technology through applications of A.I. to geophysical surveys, predictive modeling and 3D reconstructions of archaeological sites. This presents valuable inroads to repatriation, education, and cultural storytelling. Still, worries about data ownership, community consent and digital colonialism were expressed as worthy of greater attention and investigation.\n\n9) Call to Action: Local Innovation &amp; Collaboration  \n\nResoundingly heard throughout the panels was a call for the Caribbean to get involved in developing its own A.I. tools while training local talent and shaping global technology narratives. To do so, a push was made for collaboration across sectors, merging government, academia, civil society and creatives together. Overall, A.I. was deemed a transformative opportunity if approached with care, equity, and strategic vision."", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""constraint"": 0, ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Learnings on your challenge
null
What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 
We worked with government and the Barbados Museum &amp; Historical Society on hosting the A.I. Symposium on Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage. Based on this event which included 6 panels of subject matter experts, we gathered the following insights:

1) The Double-Edged Sword of A.I.

Several panelists noted the many benefits that A.I. can bring to the Orange Economy in the Caribbean, including democratizing access to cultural heritage, enhancing arts education capacities and opening new markets for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Many of these positive shifts are already being seen, even if on a small scale. On the flipside, numerous risks were noted - with the potential for A.I. to exacerbate inequalities, further entrench biases, and threaten cultural diversity. From a security standpoint, ethical concerns around data use, privacy, and intellectual property were frequently raised. This resulted in a double-edged sword dynamic requiring proper stewardship to ensure the safe usage of A.I. for creative purposes. 

2) Ethics, Equity and Human Rights

Many emphasized that any application of A.I. in the arts sector should be firmly rooted in an ethical framework based on human dignity, cultural specificity, and inclusivity. This included calls for a transparent, fair and rights-based approach to A.I. regulation. Additionally, given that A.I. tools are often consumed rather than produced in the Caribbean, it was recognized that A.I. must be anchored in local values rather than those imported externally from global tech hubs. This reflects the reality that dominant A.I. systems typically include Western biases and exclude Caribbean perspectives. As such, there is a need to train A.I. on regional data while also making efforts to protect that data from misuse.

3) Governance Gaps and the Demand for Regional Strategy

In Barbados and among the wider Caribbean, A.I. policies are under development, especially when it comes to the creative industries where issues such as deepfakes, voice cloning and unauthorized use of likenesses are prevalent. In this process, there is the distinct challenge of keeping up with the fast speed of A.I. technologies, which are constantly evolving. To address this nascent governance field, regional collaboration was recommended with emphasis on solutions co-designed with grassroots communities, artists, technologists and policymakers alongside institutions such as UNDP, BMHS and ICOM as key partners. This Caribbean-wide approach could together address A.I. policy, digital infrastructure and cultural preservation.

4) A.I. and the Orange Economy

The Orange Economy, encompassing economic activities derived from creativity, culture and innovation, is home to specific complexities when it comes to A.I., such as the requirement for protection of intellectual property in music, film, and literature. Several artists underscored the importance of understanding digital ownership, authorship and authentication in the age of A.I., resulting in a strong demand for digital rights and policies that prioritize creators. Additionally, fair compensation for creatives was mentioned and tied to the devaluation of art forms that could occur through A.I., as well as the risks of job displacement posed by emerging tools in graphic design, sound production and editing.

5) Education and Digital Capacity Building  

The Government of Barbados is integrating digital capacity-building efforts into the classroom, seen in coding, digital literacy and civics in the curriculum. These efforts are ultimately preparing students for a future deeply impacted by A.I. At the same time, arts education is focusing on critical thinking, responsible technology use and empowering youth to be active creators rather than passive consumers. This also connects to instilling a sense of integrity and ownership among art producers in the A.I. landscape.

6) A.I. and Heritage Preservation

Globally in the heritage field, A.I. is being used to digitize heritage-based archives, enhance metadata creation and support conservation. The digitization of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), which includes language, rituals, crafts and oral traditions, is a bit more complex, however, as these elements are harder to digitize and protect. Panelists found that A.I. can help document ICH, but that the fundamentals of trust, consent and cultural sensitivity must be established first. To best future-proof these efforts, the significance of open-source tools, distributed storage and non-proprietary formats for sustainability purposes were voiced.

7) Gender, LGBTQIA+ Rights &amp; Digital Safety  

Depending on its use, A.I. can amplify marginalized voices or reinforce systemic biases, thus necessitating a stringent approach to regulation and oversight. Concerns around automated harassment, surveillance, and data exploitation were raised. To mitigate these potential pitfalls, panelists recommended intersectionality, community-led safeguards and inclusive data practices in A.I. 

8) A.I. in Archaeology &amp; Heritage Preservation

In archaeology, history is meeting modern technology through applications of A.I. to geophysical surveys, predictive modeling and 3D reconstructions of archaeological sites. This presents valuable inroads to repatriation, education, and cultural storytelling. Still, worries about data ownership, community consent and digital colonialism were expressed as worthy of greater attention and investigation.

9) Call to Action: Local Innovation &amp; Collaboration  

Resoundingly heard throughout the panels was a call for the Caribbean to get involved in developing its own A.I. tools while training local talent and shaping global technology narratives. To do so, a push was made for collaboration across sectors, merging government, academia, civil society and creatives together. Overall, A.I. was deemed a transformative opportunity if approached with care, equity, and strategic vision.

Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?
We chose these types of data to get a sense of how A.I. is impacting the Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage sphere, both through desk research and also by allowing for community insights to surface through a public dialogue hosted where panelists were invited to respond to audience Q&amp;A and interact with the guests on thematic areas of interest.

Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?
As A.I. is a nascent field that is just begging to shape the Caribbean region, we had to facilitate a space for public dialogue and discussion to occur in this area. In doing so, concerns and opportunity areas expressed were mapped for potential inclusion in future A.I. policy. This type of dialogue on this subject has not occurred on a scale large enough to garner public views on A.I.'s applications to society/culture and as such, we opted to host a community conversation.

Scaling and Standardizing Agro-Libraries in Türkiye
Challenge statement
null
Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
As the concept of Agro-Libraries becomes popular, there is a risk that its meaning and standards are misunderstood, leading to low-quality or superficial implementations. Our main challenge is to protect the quality and real impact of Agro-Libraries while scaling them.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Since 2022, we have worked with an innovation challenge finalist to establish Türkiye's first Agro-Library. Over the years, this idea has spread across the country. Many schools and institutions have contacted us and the innovators for support and information. Recently, the Ministry of National Education and UNESCO have shown interest, opening doors for national and international cooperation.

Currently, there is no official, centralized dataset on Agro-Libraries in Türkiye. However, the following points highlight the importance and urgency:

·       Since 2022, over 50 requests from schools and local institutions for Agro-Library support and guidance have been received.

·       Interest from the Ministry of National Education and UNESCO shows growing national and international relevance.

·       Türkiye has over 18,000 public libraries and 60,000 schools, showing high potential for scaling, but also the risk of uncoordinated, low-quality expansion without standard





Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
Through this action learning plan, we aim to develop accreditation standards, measurement tools, and a knowledge-sharing network for Agro-Libraries. Our final goal is to integrate Agro-Libraries into Türkiye's national education system with strong quality control and sustainable impact.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
We are working to scale Türkiye’s Agro-Libraries with clear standards, accreditation, and a knowledge-sharing network — ensuring quality, real impact, and opening the door for national and international cooperation. #AgroLibrary #Innovation #Education

Integrating the principles of creative confidence and circular economy learned from this experiment will equip local producers for the Badia region with enhanced skills in sustainable product development and marketing, thus supporting the exhibition’s goal of economic empowerment.

BIG BET

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
""Our challenge is that women in Jordan’s craft sector often produce items that lack market appeal due to limited design skills, weak market linkages, and low creative confidence. This restricts their income potential and undermines the sustainability of their work, despite growing demand for unique, high-quality handicrafts.""

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
As part of the 2025 focus on adult learning and the circular economy, the Accelerator Lab is advancing socio-economic development and sustainability in Jordan. Adult learning builds a skilled workforce, while the circular economy promotes resource efficiency, waste recovery, and economic resilience. To support these goals, the lab launched an initiative to foster creative confidence as a driver of personal and professional growth. Empowering 15 women, the program encouraged them to innovate and express themselves artistically by transforming discarded materials into marketable products.

The Artistic Capacity Building for Product Innovation training offered a three-day structured program that covered artistic skills, creative thinking, and sustainable design. Participants engaged in hands-on activities, learning sketching, colour theory, and prototyping while integrating circular economy principles into product development. This initiative aimed at enhancing artistic abilities while offering practical insights into marketability and sustainable production.

The experiment is a result of observations from the tourism in Madaba research that highlighted a critical gap in the quality of high-quality, locally produced goods, which limits the country’s economic potential and appeal to tourists. This experiment seeks to address this gap by empowering women to create sustainable, high-quality products that not only meet market expectations but also reflect the rich cultural heritage of the region.

The experiment generates actionable insights and practical learnings that can directly benefit various projects run by the UNDP, particularly the upcoming permanent exhibition currently under construction by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Environment. By developing women’s creative confidence and sustainable production practices in Petra, this experiment provides a scalable model that can be adapted for Jordan’s Badia and adjacent rural communities.

 The exhibition, which will promote and sell products year-round from over 4,500 local producers supported by community-based organizations, is expected to attract 1 to 1.5 million visitors annually and generate JD 4.5 million in revenue. Integrating the principles of creative confidence and circular economy learned from this experiment will equip local producers for the Badia region with enhanced skills in sustainable product development and marketing, thus supporting the exhibition’s goal of economic empowerment. This approach ensures that the exhibition not only promotes local products but also fosters a deeper cultural and environmental connection, enhancing the market appeal and sustainability of Badia’s unique offerings.



Through its Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) project, UNDP conducted a series of training sessions aimed at empowering women from the Jordan Valley. These sessions focused on developing and enhancing products that could foster sustainable livelihoods for local communities. To gain insights and improve future initiatives, the Accelerator Lab reached out to a sample of these women to learn more about their training experiences and explore ways to create an even more impactful program for the experiment.

The experiment will help understand the preferences and convenience of both consumers and producers, helping to bridge gaps in market demand. As part of this research, we will circulate an online survey to collect insights into consumer preferences and identify which types of products are most appealing to local and visiting audiences. Additionally, the experiment will explore potential partnerships by linking the women participants to local retailers such as Al Afghani to expand their market reach.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The Accelerator Lab offers a unique, hands-on approach to boosting the marketability of women’s handicrafts through creative skills training, sustainable design, and market insights. Unlike traditional programs, we rapidly test and adapt solutions—like color theory workshops and upcycling techniques—to bridge the gap between cultural heritage and tourist demand. Our experiments, such as the Artistic Capacity Building training, prove that empowering women with design skills and confidence directly translates to more competitive products and income opportunities.

A diverse group of stakeholders, including government institutions, civil society, academia, and the private sector, are increasingly curious about exploring AI’s potential.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, challenges such as limited technical capacity, fragmented initiatives, and the absence of a unified national strategy still persist. These gaps can slow progress and risk uneven benefits. Nevertheless, the current landscape presents an opportunity to co-create a shared vision for AI that is locally grounded and globally informed, ensuring that innovation contributes to sustainable development and leaves no one behind.\n\n\n\n\nIn Peru, 57% of workers now use artificial intelligence in their daily tasks—an increase of 8 percentage points compared to 2024, when 49% reported using it. This positions Peru as a regional leader in AI adoption, ahead of Argentina and Chile (both at 55%), Panama (40%), and Ecuador (39%).

Challenge statement
null
Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is to explore how artificial intelligence can strengthen and sustain citizen participation across education, governance, and key initiatives in our Country Office, transforming collective discourse into inclusive, data-driven action.

What capacities do we need to build internally to integrate AI into our participation strategies?

How can we measure the impact of AI on participation quality and sustainability?

Which of our current CO projects are best positioned to pilot AI-enhanced participation?

How do we avoid reinforcing biases or excluding vulnerable groups in AI-driven participation?

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
UNDP supports countries to build inclusive AI ecosystems, strengthen capabilities, and implement solutions that benefit both people and the planet—working to ensure all countries can actively participate in shaping and harnessing AI's transformative potential. UNDP has adopted a strategic approach to promote the ethical, inclusive, and sustainable use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI).




In our CO, we recognize that digital transformation and AI are key drivers of change and inclusive growth. While we are still in the early stages of implementation, there is growing momentum and enthusiasm across sectors. A diverse group of stakeholders, including government institutions, civil society, academia, and the private sector, are increasingly curious about exploring AI’s potential.




However, challenges such as limited technical capacity, fragmented initiatives, and the absence of a unified national strategy still persist. These gaps can slow progress and risk uneven benefits. Nevertheless, the current landscape presents an opportunity to co-create a shared vision for AI that is locally grounded and globally informed, ensuring that innovation contributes to sustainable development and leaves no one behind.




In Peru, 57% of workers now use artificial intelligence in their daily tasks—an increase of 8 percentage points compared to 2024, when 49% reported using it. This positions Peru as a regional leader in AI adoption, ahead of Argentina and Chile (both at 55%), Panama (40%), and Ecuador (39%). Additionally, 99% of Peruvian workers consider AI useful or very useful in their daily work, reflecting a strong cultural readiness for AI integration.

Recent signals highlight the growing urgency of integrating AI into their organizations. Institutions are becoming increasingly aware of their limited capacity to apply AI effectively, particularly in the realm of public governance. At the same time, youth-focused initiatives are emerging to strengthen critical thinking in digital environments shaped by generative AI, misinformation, and algorithmic influence. Meanwhile, experts are raising concerns that AI could deepen polarization and erode democratic trust, especially in fragile democracies like Peru, where electoral processes remain vulnerable to manipulation.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The Accelerator Lab brings a cross-cutting perspective within the Peru Country Office, enabling it to test and adapt AI-driven solutions that support multiple programme areas simultaneously. With the flexibility to experiment across diverse topics and geographies, the Lab is well-positioned to pilot varied approaches to citizen participation—tailored to different contexts and communities. 

Building on previous frontier challenges focused on changemaker youth, food systems, culture, and digitalization, the Lab offers valuable insights into how people engage, build trust, and co-create in a digital era. Its experimental mandate, human-centered lens, and capacity for rapid iteration make it the ideal actor to explore how AI can be responsibly integrated to strengthen democratic participation and inclusion—filling a gap that other institutional actors may not be structurally equipped to address. This makes it both strategic and necessary to invest in this challenge through the Lab’s innovation platform.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
Can AI make citizen participation more inclusive, effective, and lasting? At UNDP Peru, we’re exploring how to turn collective voices into data-driven action—responsibly, ethically, and with everyone at the table.

Learnings on your challenge
null
What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 
Integrated Data is a Strategic Asset: Tools like the Hulhumalé Liveability Index, combined with GIS and financial data, enabled a more holistic understanding of urban development dynamics.

Strategic Diversification is Critical for Urban Resilience: Moving beyond reliance on land sales, the introduction of smart infrastructure and digital services can create long-term value and financial stability.

Governance and Risk Management Drive Sustainability: Embedding risk mitigation and transparent decision-making frameworks enhanced the credibility and adaptability of the strategic planning process.




Co-creation Enhances Strategic Relevance:Engaging HDC teams, stakeholders, and technical partners early in the design process ensured solutions were tailored, owned, and actionable.

Institutionalization Enables Long-Term Impact:The co-created strategy has transitioned into an institutional process at HDC, with a roadmap, business plans, and internal monitoring mechanisms.

Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)
Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
Our work has not yet scaled

Can you provide more detail on your handover process?
The strategic plan co-developed with HDC is now being embedded institutionally. UNDP's role has shifted from direct facilitation to advisory support, as HDC implements the plan through internal strategic planning teams and a performance framework. The strategy is now informing annual business plans and monitoring systems, driven by HDC leadership. The Maldives Accelerator Lab will continue supporting knowledge transfer, especially in areas of smart city tech and stakeholder innovation.

Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

These approaches allowed the team to unpack urban systems by connecting infrastructure, governance, and user experience. Co-creation ensured stakeholder alignment. Data visualization tools enabled pattern recognition and trade-off discussions, while smart city approaches informed future-proofing strategies. Scenario planning helped test resilience across uncertain futures.
Partners
null
Please state the name of the partner:
Housing Development Corporation Ltd. (HDC)

What sector does your partner belong to?
Government (&amp;related)

Please provide a brief description of the partnership.
The Maldives Accelerator Lab collaborated with HDC to design and deliver the corporation’s 2025–2030 Strategic Plan. This included diagnostic work, stakeholder engagement, strategic roadmap design, and performance monitoring tools to institutionalize good governance, innovation, and financial sustainability.

Is this a new and unusual partner for UNDP?
No
End
null
Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
The convergence of innovation methods (e.g., scenario planning), new forms of ESG and spatial data, and deep collaboration with a government SOE (HDC) allowed us to move beyond siloed planning. It created a shared language for sustainability, enabling systemic insights into how urban resilience, governance, and financial viability intersect. This level of insight and uptake would not have been possible using traditional planning processes alone."

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is to balance urban expansion with sustainable resource management while ensuring financial stability, efficiency,and strong governance. Through UNDP’s support for HDC in their strategic planning, we are providing actionable insights into development to create resilient, future-ready cities in the Maldives by 2030.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
The Housing Development Corporation (HDC) significantly influences the urban environment of the Maldives, aiming to transform quality living through sustainable urban development. HDC oversees the creation of Hulhumalé, the country's largest residential city, designed to house two-thirds of the population. In addition, HDC is developing an industrial island for waste management, a tourism commercial island, and extensive reclamation projects for new artificial

cities. The Maldives contends with issues like limited land availability and concentrated urban population. As HDC broadens its urban development efforts, it needs a strategic approach to resource management. The strategic plan for

2025-2030 focuses on improving financial stability, operational efficiency, governance, and long-term sustainability while

responding to socio-economic and environmental shifts. This strategic planning, driven by UNDP and HDC, is informed by the 2023 Hulhumalé Liveability Index study, using its pillars and scores as the framework for the strategic plan.

Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The Maldives Accelerator Lab has been leading this partnership with HDC for over two years, and the SAP initiative emerged as an extension of the existing co-financing agreement established with HDC, resulting in Acclab colleagues leading the engagement from CO. In 2023, this collaboration developed the country’s first City Liveability Index for Hulhumale, now featured on a dashboard on the HDC website. The current SAP work has mainly been directed and informed by the scores of the Liveability Index. Furthermore, the current landscape assessment of the SAP has focused on digital and innovative solutions, another key area of interest for the Maldives Acclab in 2025. There is significant potential to leverage smart cities and data-driven decision-making to enhance our co-financing partnership further and attract other donors.

However, their full mandate remains unclear, with limited delivery on core functions. NCIT shows limited evidence of having performed a leadership role in the government’s digital service implantation – for example but doing setting technical standards across government systems, defining the governments service and data architecture, and other functions ideally suited for an agency such as the NCIT. While there are some exceptions, such as website standards, it remains unclear how effectively these standards are monitored and evaluated. NCIT has led several shared services initiatives, such as the Government E-Mail Service (GEMS) and a data centre. However, it does not manage all government data, with individual agencies adopting varied approaches. \n\nDue to unclear mandates and a lack of clear separation of functions between government institutions, several institutions are involved in the implementation of digital projects. NCIT oversees the implementation of several digitalization projects, such as GEMS (the government task management system) and eFaas (the national digital identification system). TradeNnet, another organization that is a State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) implements several other government digitalization projects, such as OneGov (the unified digital public service delivery platform of the Government of the Maldives), and the Maldives National Single Window (MNSW, a centralized digital platform designed to streamline international trade by enabling trade and transport parties to submit standard information and documents through a single entry point). Additionally, government departments, which have the capacity, develop and implement their own digitalization projectslxxix.   \n \n\nEven though progress is seen in policy and programme development, there is limited coordination and consultation. While the Maldives has implemented several promising digitalisation initiatives in areas such as social protection, healthcare, and the legal sector (these efforts appear to be developed in a relatively ad hoc manner. Many key developments are also underway in the digital sector, with the development of numerous laws (Privacy and Personal Data Protection, Cybersecurity, Digital Government Services) and strategies (Digital Transformation, Artificial Intelligence), amongst others. However, policymaking in the digital sector is seemingly occurring in silos, with limited coordination between parallel efforts. For instance, the development of several strategies appear to have proceeded without explicit directives for alignment or coordination across agencies/sectors. There is limited evidence of unified strategy-setting or a coordinated push to drive digital transformation across sectors, which could adversely affect achievement of government’s envisioned objective. Furthermore, the pace at which some of these are developed is rushed, with limited meaningful consultation with relevant stakeholders. Unless the efforts are coordinated, coherent, and well consulted, fragmentation is likely to continue. \n\nThis lack of coordination vision, leadership and action is leading to inefficiencies. Due to the lack of overarching government services architecture and no clear definition of who will develop core and common services that can be (re)used by all other systems, it appears that many different government organizations are procuring and implementing very similar systems, often developing software components that have already been developed elsewhere. This is likely highly economically inefficient. More importantly, the lack of interoperability standards, data standards, and other technical standards means these systems will not easily share data or communicate with each other. As a result, a ‘government-wide’ service orientation is missed, compounding the economic inefficiencies.  \n\nIn 2024 UNDP worked with NCIT and President’s office to conduct a comprehensive situation analysis of digital transformation in Maldives. The assessment covered 5 pillars of UNDP’s digital transformation framework and was drafted based on wide consultations with government, private sector, civil society and other stakeholders. The government was involved in the process and the findings of the report were shared with partner agencies with the intention that UNDP will work with government to formulate a national digital transformation strategy.  However, the response and willingness from government mandate holder has been limited. Given the challenges engaging government on strategy development, UNDP has decided to work with the Think Tank who conducted the assessment to put forth recommendations to the government and execute a communication and advocacy campaign with the aim of influencing the digital transformation policy in the country.  "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

On the other hand, it performed poorly on 2 sub-indices: the GovTech Enablers Index  indicating a lack of institutions, laws, skills, and policies required for government digital transformation, and the Digital Citizen Engagement Index, indicating poor performance in indicators such as the availability of open government websites, open data portals, national platforms that allow citizens to participate in policy decision-making, provide feedback on service delivery, and whether the government publishes its citizen engagement statistics.  The ITU’s ICT Regulatory Tracker also highlight significant room for improvement, being classified as ‘G5 - Limited’ – the lowest of 4 categories, on the digital transformation readiness scale.  "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""9ca8bdba-cf1b-48fd-872f-b019d0d5fb74"", ""src"": null, ""html"": ""\n"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""left"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""5b0edd22-f7cc-4d9c-9f6b-2ac95cf86bae"", ""src"": null, ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""scale"": ""original"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""center"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": """"}]], ""level"": ""media"", ""structure"": [{""id"": ""45c2f1c7-0640-4562-89b5-c541ae3e8a56"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""is_excerpt"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""9ca8bdba-cf1b-48fd-872f-b019d0d5fb74"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""5b0edd22-f7cc-4d9c-9f6b-2ac95cf86bae"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}], ""instruction"": ""Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge?

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that Maldives digital transformation approach is fragmented and uncoordinated, leading to slow progress and inefficiencies.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Maldives has always lacked a unified vision and clear leadership for digital transformation. 

The Ministry of Homeland Security and Technology houses many key agencies related to digital initiatives, including the National Centre for Information Technology (NCIT), Cyber Security Agency (CSA), and the Communications Authority of Maldives (CAM), positioning it as a central authority for most matters in the sector.  NCIT was established in 2003 and designated as a National Centre approximately a decade later. However, their full mandate remains unclear, with limited delivery on core functions. NCIT shows limited evidence of having performed a leadership role in the government’s digital service implantation – for example but doing setting technical standards across government systems, defining the governments service and data architecture, and other functions ideally suited for an agency such as the NCIT. While there are some exceptions, such as website standards, it remains unclear how effectively these standards are monitored and evaluated. NCIT has led several shared services initiatives, such as the Government E-Mail Service (GEMS) and a data centre. However, it does not manage all government data, with individual agencies adopting varied approaches. 

Due to unclear mandates and a lack of clear separation of functions between government institutions, several institutions are involved in the implementation of digital projects. NCIT oversees the implementation of several digitalization projects, such as GEMS (the government task management system) and eFaas (the national digital identification system). TradeNnet, another organization that is a State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) implements several other government digitalization projects, such as OneGov (the unified digital public service delivery platform of the Government of the Maldives), and the Maldives National Single Window (MNSW, a centralized digital platform designed to streamline international trade by enabling trade and transport parties to submit standard information and documents through a single entry point). Additionally, government departments, which have the capacity, develop and implement their own digitalization projectslxxix.   
 

Even though progress is seen in policy and programme development, there is limited coordination and consultation. While the Maldives has implemented several promising digitalisation initiatives in areas such as social protection, healthcare, and the legal sector (these efforts appear to be developed in a relatively ad hoc manner. Many key developments are also underway in the digital sector, with the development of numerous laws (Privacy and Personal Data Protection, Cybersecurity, Digital Government Services) and strategies (Digital Transformation, Artificial Intelligence), amongst others. However, policymaking in the digital sector is seemingly occurring in silos, with limited coordination between parallel efforts. For instance, the development of several strategies appear to have proceeded without explicit directives for alignment or coordination across agencies/sectors. There is limited evidence of unified strategy-setting or a coordinated push to drive digital transformation across sectors, which could adversely affect achievement of government’s envisioned objective. Furthermore, the pace at which some of these are developed is rushed, with limited meaningful consultation with relevant stakeholders. Unless the efforts are coordinated, coherent, and well consulted, fragmentation is likely to continue. 

This lack of coordination vision, leadership and action is leading to inefficiencies. Due to the lack of overarching government services architecture and no clear definition of who will develop core and common services that can be (re)used by all other systems, it appears that many different government organizations are procuring and implementing very similar systems, often developing software components that have already been developed elsewhere. This is likely highly economically inefficient. More importantly, the lack of interoperability standards, data standards, and other technical standards means these systems will not easily share data or communicate with each other. As a result, a ‘government-wide’ service orientation is missed, compounding the economic inefficiencies.  

In 2024 UNDP worked with NCIT and President’s office to conduct a comprehensive situation analysis of digital transformation in Maldives. The assessment covered 5 pillars of UNDP’s digital transformation framework and was drafted based on wide consultations with government, private sector, civil society and other stakeholders. The government was involved in the process and the findings of the report were shared with partner agencies with the intention that UNDP will work with government to formulate a national digital transformation strategy.  However, the response and willingness from government mandate holder has been limited. Given the challenges engaging government on strategy development, UNDP has decided to work with the Think Tank who conducted the assessment to put forth recommendations to the government and execute a communication and advocacy campaign with the aim of influencing the digital transformation policy in the country.

The Maldives has a mixed performance across key international benchmarks that assess the state of its digital development. Maldives is ranked 94 out of 193 United Nations member states in the E-Government Development Index (EGDI). Unlike the EGDI, the Maldives performs poorly in the GTMI compared to its peers in the South Asian region, ranking only ahead of Afghanistan. Maldives scored highest in the Public Service Delivery Index (0.74/1) among the sub-indices, which measure the maturity of online public service portals, focusing on citizen-centric design and universal accessibility. On the other hand, it performed poorly on 2 sub-indices: the GovTech Enablers Index  indicating a lack of institutions, laws, skills, and policies required for government digital transformation, and the Digital Citizen Engagement Index, indicating poor performance in indicators such as the availability of open government websites, open data portals, national platforms that allow citizens to participate in policy decision-making, provide feedback on service delivery, and whether the government publishes its citizen engagement statistics.  The ITU’s ICT Regulatory Tracker also highlight significant room for improvement, being classified as ‘G5 - Limited’ – the lowest of 4 categories, on the digital transformation readiness scale.

Challenge statement
null
Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that lack an integrated, end-to-end system to seamlessly link locally collected ground-truth data with satellite-based remote sensing observations and transform that combined information into standardized, verifiable metrics for reporting carbon footprints and carbon sequestration.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Mongolia’s rangelands, which cover over 70% of the country and support its livestock-based economy, are increasingly degraded due to overgrazing, climate change, and unsustainable land use. This degradation threatens rural livelihoods, biodiversity, and national climate goals, particularly since livestock emissions comprise a major part of Mongolia’s GHG reduction commitments. Despite interest in green finance, the lack of credible, standardized data on rangeland health and carbon impacts hampers progress. Current data systems are centralized, slow, and costly, with limited integration of local knowledge. The challenge involves multiple stakeholders—herders, policymakers, and financial institutions—and produces undesired effects such as weak climate finance readiness, poor land management decisions, and limited access to voluntary carbon markets. In response, a national AI-powered, participatory MRV system is being developed to provide real-time, verifiable data to support sustainable land use, climate finance mobilization, and inclusive governance.

We have ground cover images and the python code that calculates green cover of the image



Depending on the peson taking photo samples the scales and quality of the images are different which makes the data analysis difficult to distinguish the different photo samples



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The Accelarator lab is developing random pixel sampling which is then linked to ML model. We are looking at different data analysis solutions which then later will be proposed to other national stakeholders to be introduced into the green loan. Currently the banking sector is not using such data analysis technologies. We believe once the models trained and the monitoring is continuously working Mongolia can have a solid information ground which will be tailored for other green labelled actions.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
Bridging local ground-truth surveys and satellite data via ML-driven pixel sampling to deliver real-time, verifiable carbon footprint &amp; sequestration insights—unlocking data-backed green loans and carbon markets for Mongolia.

Learning questions
null
Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?
1. Which spectral indices (e.g. NDVI, EVI, MSAVI) and sensor bands correlate most strongly with plot-level biomass and soil carbon across Mongolia’s natural zones?

2. How do we translate raw reflectance at 10–30 m resolution into per-hectare carbon estimates that align with field measurements?

3. What model architectures (e.g. Random Forests vs. CNNs) offer the best trade-off between accuracy, interpretability, and compute cost for on-device inference?

4. What uncertainty-quantification framework (e.g. Monte Carlo, bootstrapping) meets UNFCCC/green-loan auditing standards for carbon reporting?

Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?
Enriched photo metadata and automated random‐pixel sampling bridge the consistency and representativeness gap between field images and 10–30 m satellite pixels, directly improving our calibration and standardization. Meanwhile, high-resolution drone/LiDAR, continuous multispectral time-series, IoT soil sensors, and dashboard analytics fill scale, temporal, and trust gaps—providing dynamic carbon flux data, robust uncertainty estimates, and stakeholder validation essential for a credible MRV platform.

Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
Key early champions include the Ministry of Environment and Tourism and the Development Bank of Mongolia, which can pilot integration of MRV outputs into national reporting and green‐loan products. Local herder cooperatives and NGOs like WWF-Mongolia will benefit directly from improved pasture management data and can drive grassroots adoption.

Placing a strong focus on capacity building, we have followed the path of several iterating learning loops during these first 5 years, having generated both impact and key lessons for the development of policies for public innovation.\n\n# Public innovation: from public sector innovation to a national system of public innovation\n\nIn the public sector, the challenge of increasing the capacity of innovation follows the need of delivering better public services and designing better public policies, which directly affect citizens’ wellbeing by making fundamental rights a reality: quality public education, affordable public healthcare, access to basic services such as energy and water; public innovation has the potential to improve all of these through better public services and policies. In turn, public goods such as these services can reduce vulnerabilities and turn back the dial on inequalities, a key factor of democratic backsliding as shown by the 2023/2024 Human Development Report “Breaking the gridlock” and the 2024 UNDP Trends Report “The Landscape of Development”. As inequality rises, the strength of democracy falls, leading to a pressing social scenario where most of the half of the world population are supporting leaders that erode democracy. Public innovation, therefore, is an enabler in the path toward stopping democratic backsliding.\n\nAt the same time, the public sector is facing new challenges with the arrival of frontier technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), both in its internal and external relations and outcomes. The opportunities and risks that come with AI make the need to innovate even more relevant: to seize the potential of AI for good while mitigating its dangers, public innovation needs to emerge in the institutional, social, and technological dimensions of our public services and policies, to improve the quality of their outcomes and to respond to the contemporary problems of the citizens, including the need for a better and more direct relation and participation.\n\nPublic innovation is therefore a fundamental cornerstone of citizens’ wellbeing and the quality of our democracies. How do we build up the nations’ muscle for this type of innovation? The capacity for public innovation depends on how much research, development and innovation tools and methods are integrated into institutional functions, mechanisms, and human capital, across government institutions and other organizations that support the design and implementation of public policies and services.\n\nTo face that challenge, since 2019, the AccLab has been working closely with Paraguay’s National Innovation Strategy (ENI), a cross-cutting public-private initiative that is working to promote a better change within the system. Another key ally is the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), who has committed significant financial resources to carry out the capacity building programs that will strengthen scientific capacity, as well as directly supporting different forms of innovation. By asking how we can develop capacities for innovation in the public sector, we engaged with these allies in a continuous learning journey which is now entering its fifth year. In each new learning cycle, new lessons emerged about how to build capacities for research, development and innovation in the public sector, and its key supporting organizations. We first helped ENI identify the key national innovation challenges that today orient public policies such as the Science, Technology, and Innovation Agenda of CONACYT (https://www.conacyt.gov.py/documentos-agenda-nacional-ciencia-tecnologia-innovacion). As the pandemic ensued, our learning turn to how we can articulate the national innovation system toward one of those challenges, which was already aligned to the challenge increasing resilience against pandemics (https://www.conacyt.gov.py/presentaron-plataforma-innovadora-para-fortalecer-iniciativas-emprendedores). Articulation opened the opportunity to apply our R&amp;D+i methods to specific challenges within this bigger one in 2021, through Wendá (https://wenda.org.py/).\n\nAs a result of this alliance, the Public Innovators Program was born in 2022. The Program builds capacities in public officials from several national institutions through hands-on training, mentoring, and the development of innovation pilots. During its first three editions, the Program trained over 150 public officials and supported the implementation and evaluation of 16 public innovation pilots.\nThis year, the Program enters its fourth edition, incorporating 40 more public officials organized into 10 institutional teams. Based on lessons learned from past editions, this cycle introduces new improvements and opens the door for greater collaboration.\n"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

Better public policies and services are key to stop this trendEspecially because levels of trust between citizens is high, which is an asset for solutions to rise through co-creation.\n \nThe challenges of a more sustainable energy transition represent an ideal opportunity to put both putlic and social innovation at work.

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is to promote, build, and scale up public and social innovation capacities to strengthen how institutions and organizations across sectors address development challenges at national and local levels.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Since its beginning in 2019, the AccLabPY has priotized social and public innovation as key enablers of sustainable development at all levels. Placing a strong focus on capacity building, we have followed the path of several iterating learning loops during these first 5 years, having generated both impact and key lessons for the development of policies for public innovation.

# Public innovation: from public sector innovation to a national system of public innovation

In the public sector, the challenge of increasing the capacity of innovation follows the need of delivering better public services and designing better public policies, which directly affect citizens’ wellbeing by making fundamental rights a reality: quality public education, affordable public healthcare, access to basic services such as energy and water; public innovation has the potential to improve all of these through better public services and policies. In turn, public goods such as these services can reduce vulnerabilities and turn back the dial on inequalities, a key factor of democratic backsliding as shown by the 2023/2024 Human Development Report “Breaking the gridlock” and the 2024 UNDP Trends Report “The Landscape of Development”. As inequality rises, the strength of democracy falls, leading to a pressing social scenario where most of the half of the world population are supporting leaders that erode democracy. Public innovation, therefore, is an enabler in the path toward stopping democratic backsliding.

At the same time, the public sector is facing new challenges with the arrival of frontier technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), both in its internal and external relations and outcomes. The opportunities and risks that come with AI make the need to innovate even more relevant: to seize the potential of AI for good while mitigating its dangers, public innovation needs to emerge in the institutional, social, and technological dimensions of our public services and policies, to improve the quality of their outcomes and to respond to the contemporary problems of the citizens, including the need for a better and more direct relation and participation.

Public innovation is therefore a fundamental cornerstone of citizens’ wellbeing and the quality of our democracies. How do we build up the nations’ muscle for this type of innovation? The capacity for public innovation depends on how much research, development and innovation tools and methods are integrated into institutional functions, mechanisms, and human capital, across government institutions and other organizations that support the design and implementation of public policies and services.

To face that challenge, since 2019, the AccLab has been working closely with Paraguay’s National Innovation Strategy (ENI), a cross-cutting public-private initiative that is working to promote a better change within the system. Another key ally is the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), who has committed significant financial resources to carry out the capacity building programs that will strengthen scientific capacity, as well as directly supporting different forms of innovation. By asking how we can develop capacities for innovation in the public sector, we engaged with these allies in a continuous learning journey which is now entering its fifth year. In each new learning cycle, new lessons emerged about how to build capacities for research, development and innovation in the public sector, and its key supporting organizations. We first helped ENI identify the key national innovation challenges that today orient public policies such as the Science, Technology, and Innovation Agenda of CONACYT (https://www.conacyt.gov.py/documentos-agenda-nacional-ciencia-tecnologia-innovacion). As the pandemic ensued, our learning turn to how we can articulate the national innovation system toward one of those challenges, which was already aligned to the challenge increasing resilience against pandemics (https://www.conacyt.gov.py/presentaron-plataforma-innovadora-para-fortalecer-iniciativas-emprendedores). Articulation opened the opportunity to apply our R&amp;D+i methods to specific challenges within this bigger one in 2021, through Wendá (https://wenda.org.py/).

As a result of this alliance, the Public Innovators Program was born in 2022. The Program builds capacities in public officials from several national institutions through hands-on training, mentoring, and the development of innovation pilots. During its first three editions, the Program trained over 150 public officials and supported the implementation and evaluation of 16 public innovation pilots.
This year, the Program enters its fourth edition, incorporating 40 more public officials organized into 10 institutional teams. Based on lessons learned from past editions, this cycle introduces new improvements and opens the door for greater collaboration.

Latest data show the importance and urgency of public innovation to improve government outcomes through its public services and policies, and the potential of social and local innovation to localize SDGs and solve local development challenges.
 
Governance indicators signal an erossion of democracy. Although the macro-economic is stable, the inequalities are increasing, affecting also the citizen trust and satisfaction with the government. Better public policies and services are key to stop this trendEspecially because levels of trust between citizens is high, which is an asset for solutions to rise through co-creation.
 
The challenges of a more sustainable energy transition represent an ideal opportunity to put both putlic and social innovation at work. Local experiences show both cost-effectiveness and scalability potentials, which can be a key solution for the upcoming energy deficit the projections are showing. Some key quantitative data references are the following:

Trends show an even more complex world, with instability and deepened inequalities. Also, future trends present a path to development by strengthening local actors, such as communities and local governments, increasing the citizens' action capacity.

Innovations at national and local level increase government performance, allowing it to deliver better services, therefore improving citizens’ perception and wellbeing.

Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The AccLabPY brings unique value to the Public Innovators Program, which it co-leads alongside the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). This strategic partnership has positioned the Program as a flagship initiative to build innovation capacities within the public sector.

The Lab plays a central role in its design, implementation, and scaling, offering an approach grounded in experimentation, systems thinking, and co-creation.

Specifically, the AccLab adds value in three key ways:

1) Institutional strengthening: By co-designing and supporting the Program with CONACYT and IDB, the Lab ensures alignment with national priorities while fostering the institutionalization of public innovation practices.
2) Hands-on capacity building: Through its mentorship and methodological support, the Lab helps public servants learn by doing accompanying the design, testing, and evaluation of pilot projects that address real institutional and citizen needs.
3) Network building and articulation: The Lab acts as a connector among national government actors, local institutions, academia, and the private sector positioning the Program as a platform for collaborative innovation.

The success of the Program with over 150 public officials trained and 16 pilot projects developed across its first three editions reflects the strategic role of the AccLab in bridging gaps between policy, people, and practical implementation. Its continued leadership ensures the Program’s potential for scale and its contribution to a more innovative and responsive public sector.

This approach ensures that solutions are grounded in real contexts, and that public innovation is inclusive, empathetic, and relevant.

2) Prototyping will be used to turn ideas into tangible early-stage versions that can be tested within institutions. This method allows public officials to experiment, gather feedback, and iterate before scaling. It also creates a safe space to learn from failure and adapt solutions based on what works in practice.

Together, these methods will not only build capacities in innovation, but also generate actionable insights on how these capacities can become sustained practices ultimately leading to improved public services and community-led solutions for sustainable development.

datasources: insights from co-creation workshops
datasources: user interviews and ethnographic observations
datasources: documentation of prototyping cycles
datasources: reflections and learning logs

Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?
Traditional public sector data in Paraguay tends to focus on administrative, quantitative, and output-level indicators (e.g., service coverage, budget execution), which often overlook the human experience, institutional dynamics, and implementation challenges of public services and innovation processes.

The new data sources we are using help address several key gaps:

1) Lack of user perspective: Co-creation insights and user interviews allow us to incorporate the voices of citizens and frontline staff something rarely captured in official reports or policy evaluations.
2) Limited understanding of institutional barriers: Ethnographic observations and learning logs provide qualitative evidence of the day-to-day obstacles that public officials face when trying to innovate within their organizations.
3) Absence of implementation feedback loops: Prototyping documentation and iterative feedback help us track how ideas evolve, what adaptations are necessary, and what conditions enable or block the adoption of new solutions.
4) Uncaptured learning processes: Reflections from participants shed light on the development of innovation mindsets and practices an area not typically measured but critical for long-term capacity building.


By addressing these data gaps, we are able to generate a deeper and more actionable understanding of how innovation capacities are built and how they influence the design and delivery of more effective, inclusive, and sustainable public services.

Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
In the growth phase of this challenge, key beneficiaries and potential champions include:

1) Public institutions that have already participated in the Public Innovators Program and are ready to scale successful pilots or integrate innovation practices more structurally into their operations.
2) The National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), as strategic partners that can help consolidate institutional support and expand the Program's reach.
3) Civil society and private sector partners that have collaborated during the co-creation phases can become long-term allies in scaling solutions and creating cross-sector ecosystems for innovation."

Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.

BIG BET

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that tourism locations along the Kwanza river require development and promotion, since there is an increasing interest from African American communities in visiting these historical sites. There is a need to mobilize resources in partnership with the Ministry of Tourism.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The town of Massangano, in the province of Cuanza Norte, has great historical relevance for Angola. Located at the confluence of the Cuanza and Lucala rivers, it has potential for cultural and ecological tourism, connecting with pre-colonial heritage and the slave trade. The site includes historic monuments, and there are efforts to preserve and enhance the heritage, with the potential to make it a key tourist destination. Historical evidence reveals a direct connection between early African-American families and records of enslaved individuals who trace their origins to Angola. Massangano was an important departure point for those who were taken to the Americas. In 1619, the first Africans from Angola arrived on the shores of Hampton Roads. It is estimated that over 12 million Americans in the United States are of Angolan descent. The Tucker family is descended from the first Africans enslaved in North America. The William Tucker 1624 Society intends to continue collaborating with the Government of Angola in various areas. Promoting tourism with a focus on Afro-descendant culture in Angola can be a gateway to strengthening international cooperation and community development.

Over the past few years, our Country Office, and particularly the Co_Lab, have collaborated with diverse actors—from ministries to local governments— to promote inclusive, people-centered approaches to digitalization.\n\nKey milestones include:\n\nRed Con Vos (since 2021): A network of nearby stores promoting digital inclusion, helping\n\nneighbors with their online tasks, along two municipalities. Recognized by the OECD\n\nObservatory of Public Sector Innovation, it became a reference model\n\nadopted by other UNDP Labs. https://www.undp.org/es/argentina/proyectos/little-help-my-neighbors\n\nAI Agenda (since 2023): The Lab has led the AI strategy  along with different stakeholders, government agencies, universities, within others, producing research, hosting public seminars, and developing tools to promote responsible, inclusive uses of AI aligned with development goals. https://inteligenciaargentina.org/en/\n\nInternal digital strategy: Within the Country Office, we’ve launched the Digital Fitness Programme (in partnership with the Chief Digital Office) and established a Digital Task Force to strengthen team-wide digital\n\nliteracy and foster purposeful experimentation with AI, blockchain, and data-driven decision-making.\n\nProvince of Buenos Aires: In partnership with the Ministry of Community Development, we conducted a comprehensive diagnostic of citizen request systems and are now co-designing a One-Stop Digital Request Platform, addressing fragmentation and inefficiencies in public service delivery.\n\nComodoro Rivadavia (2025): In collaboration with Comodoro Conocimiento and the Health\n\nSecretariat, we are developing a digital tool for HIV prevention and care, rooted in human-centered design. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to localize digital transformation and tackle public health challenges through accessible and sustainable technological solutions.\n\nCitizen empowerment through data: The Contar con Datos challenge promotes data literacy and the use of storytelling to generate public value. The initiative fosters citizen engagement with open datasets, transforming information into insight-driven narratives that can shape public decision-making.\n\nThis track record illustrates a strategic evolution—from isolated pilot initiatives to a comprehensive digital\n\ntransformation strategy that integrates top-down institutional engagement with bottom-up experimentation alongside communities and local actors. It also highlights a growing internal demand within UNDP and among its partners for capacity building, practical tools, and long-term digital strategies.\n\nOur current challenge is to connect, scale, and consolidate these efforts, moving beyond promising pilots toward sustainable, people-centered digital ecosystems."", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

The UNDP Digital Strategy 2022–2025 notes that most staff lack systematic training in coredigital skills, limiting our ability to support national efforts. This isespecially evident in areas like AI, blockchain, and user-centered digital design. As a result, many innovation initiatives stall due to limited technical follow-up. At the same time, rising internal demand for digital expertise highlights both growing awareness and the urgent need for structured capacity-building.\n\nIn the Argentine public sector, structural and systemic challenges are also reflected in quantitative evidence. A 2024 study by CIPPEC, which assessed the digital maturity of municipal governments across 23 provincial capitals, reported an average overall score of 0.55 (on a scale from 0 to 1) for digital public\n\nservices. While usability and transactional functionality received relatively higher scores—0.62 and 0.69 respectively—the average for data governance was markedly low, at just 0.34. This highlights the critical underdevelopment of strategic data management practices at the local level. The study also revealed that only two-thirds of the municipalities surveyed had established any kind of local regulatory framework for digital policy. The remaining third operated under provincial or national laws, lacking local norms to guide key areas such as artificial intelligence, data ethics, or open data strategy.\n\nAt the national level, the scale of fragmentation is equally pronounced. In 2019, the Auditor General’s Office (AGN) reported that Argentina’s federal public administration was operating with 2,781 distinct IT systems across ministries and agencies. This level of technological disintegration significantly limits interoperability, causes duplication of data and effort, and hampers both service delivery and monitoring. The shortage of technical talent further compounds these challenges. Many municipalities report chronic difficulties in recruiting and retaining professionals with expertise in areas such as programming, data analysis, and digital infrastructure. Public sector salaries are often uncompetitive, and structured training or upskilling opportunities for existing staff are scarce. Although some local governments have started to build informal partnerships with universities and tech organizations, these remain isolated efforts rather than part of a coherent national strategy.\n\nTaken together, these quantitative indicators paint a picture of a public sector that, while increasingly aware of the need for digital transformation, still lacks the institutional scaffolding, human resources, and regulatory frameworks necessary to implement it at scale. This Action Plan is built precisely to respond to these limitations, working to close capacity gaps through a combination of internal development, strategic partnerships, and context-sensitive, people-centered innovation."", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""9ca8bdba-cf1b-48fd-872f-b019d0d5fb74"", ""src"": null, ""html"": """", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""left"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""5b0edd22-f7cc-4d9c-9f6b-2ac95cf86bae"", ""src"": null, ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""scale"": ""original"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""center"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": """"}]], ""level"": ""media"", ""structure"": [{""id"": ""45c2f1c7-0640-4562-89b5-c541ae3e8a56"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""is_excerpt"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""9ca8bdba-cf1b-48fd-872f-b019d0d5fb74"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""5b0edd22-f7cc-4d9c-9f6b-2ac95cf86bae"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}], ""instruction"": ""Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge?

These insights reveal not only structural and technological barriers, but also deeply rooted institutional and cultural dynamics that shape the country’s capacity to adopt and sustain digital innovation.\n\nAt the national level, research by organizations such as Fundar has shown that Argentina lacks centralized leadership for data governance and maintains no comprehensive inventory of public datasets. This results in significant ambiguity regarding which institutions produce specific data, how it is used, and under what standards. Even as transparency initiatives have led to the publication of open datasets, there are few institutional mechanisms in place to guarantee data quality, ensure interoperability, or promote strategic use. The absence of a national data strategy and formal governance frameworks severely limits the public sector’s ability to leverage information as a tool for innovation and decision-making.\n\nThese challenges are mirrored—and often magnified—at the local level. Interviews conducted by CIPPEC with municipal officials reveal a widespread lack of coordination between departments, with most operating on isolated digital systems that do not share taxonomies, data models, or workflows. In practice, this results in fragmented service delivery, where citizens are forced to repeat procedures and information cannot be efficiently reused across agencies. Municipalities also report a persistent scarcity of technical personnel, particularly in areas like data science, software development, and AI application. The difficulty in hiring and retaining talent is exacerbated by low public sector salaries, limited career development opportunities, and a lack of internal training programs. While some local governments have begun to partner with universities or the private sector to address these issues, such initiatives tend to be informal and short-term, rather than part of institutional strategies.\n\nA concrete example of these limitations comes from the Province of Buenos Aires. Between September and November 2024, UNDP’s Accelerator Lab partnered with the Ministry of Community Development to conduct an in-depth assessment of its citizen request management system. Through interviews with front-desk staff, call center operators, social workers, request coordinators, and high-level officials, the diagnostic uncovered a highly fragmented structure. Different teams handled citizen requests independently, with little coordination, no shared protocols, and minimal use of integrated digital tools. Communication between teams often relied on informal channels such as WhatsApp or personal email accounts, raising concerns about data privacy and operational accountability. Many processes were tracked manually using outdated formats like Excel spreadsheets, making it difficult to monitor requests, follow up on unresolved issues, or analyze patterns to inform policy.\n\nThese qualitative findings reveal that Argentina’s digital gaps are not only technical, but deeply institutional and cultural. They reflect a broader need for trust-building, organizational redesign, and human-centered innovation. By grounding our action plan in this firsthand understanding of how systems actually operate, we aim to co-create digital transformation strategies that are not only technically sound, but also socially embedded and operationally sustainable.\n\nRuiz Nicolini, J.

This is why our strategy combines both top-down and bottom-up approaches. At the institutional level, we work to align digital transformation with broader governance and sustainability priorities, providing governments with the tools, insights, and support needed to modernize services, enhance accountability, and strengthen resilience. At the grassroots level, we engage directly with civil society, local innovation labs, and frontline staff to co-design solutions that are both technically feasible and socially grounded.\n\nInternally, we are building digital capacity within the UNDP Country Office through structured training programs, knowledge-sharing initiatives, and active experimentation with emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, and data science. These efforts aim to position our teams as reliable partners for government counterparts navigating their own digital transitions.\n\nExternally, our work spans from redesigning citizen request systems in the Province of Buenos Aires, to supporting the creation of digital health tools in Comodoro Rivadavia, to promoting data literacy and civic participation through storytelling challenges like “Contar con Datos.” In each case, we combine policy expertise, service design, and inclusive innovation to produce solutions that are scalable, ethical, and responsive to real-world complexity.\n\nIt is important to highlight that we are also mindful of the other side of digitalization—the unintended consequences that can emerge in increasingly digital societies. In parallel to this action plan, through our resilience agenda, we are exploring how digital tools and platforms may exacerbate challenges such as unwanted loneliness, social fragmentation, or reduced access for those excluded from digital systems. As we promote digital transformation, we are committed to doing so responsibly—ensuring that the solutions we co-create do not deepen inequalities or create new vulnerabilities. By integrating this perspective into our work, we aim to foster a more holistic, ethical, and human-centered approach to digitalization."", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge?

Enunciado del reto: ¿Cuál es su reto? (Por favor, responda con precisión: «Nuestro reto es que...»).
La transformación digital está transformando el funcionamiento de gobiernos, instituciones y organizaciones, lo que exige no solo mejores infraestructuras y herramientas, sino también cambios profundos en la alfabetización digital, la capacidad institucional y la participación ciudadana. A medida que los gobiernos recurren cada vez más a la toma de decisiones basada en datos, los principios de gobierno abierto y tecnologías emergentes como la IA y la cadena de bloques, el desafío ya no se limita a la adopción, sino a la integración con un propósito.

En Argentina, las brechas digitales persistentes reflejan desigualdades más amplias: sistemas fragmentados, gobernanza de datos deficiente y capacidad pública limitada para implementar, escalar y sostener la innovación digital. Si bien las herramientas digitales están más disponibles que nunca, a menudo no se traducen en servicios públicos eficaces e inclusivos debido a la escasez de habilidades, enfoques aislados y falta de alineación estratégica.

Nuestro objetivo es:

-Fortalecer las capacidades digitales dentro de la Oficina de País y entre los socios gubernamentales, alineando esfuerzos

con prioridades más amplias de sostenibilidad y gobernanza.

-Co-crear soluciones digitales con actores locales (desde ministerios nacionales hasta gobiernos locales y laboratorios de innovación municipales), garantizando que las intervenciones sean técnicamente sólidas y socialmente fundamentadas.

-Promover la alfabetización de datos y la participación cívica, empoderando a los ciudadanos para utilizar los datos de manera significativa y ética.

-Explorar el uso responsable de la IA, la cadena de bloques y la ciencia de datos para la innovación pública, reconociendo al mismo tiempo

y mitigar riesgos como la exclusión, la fragmentación o la vigilancia.

Este desafío es complejo, sistémico y evolutivo. Requiere acciones interconectadas en todos los niveles y una transformación digital que priorice a las personas, fortaleciendo la autonomía, la confianza y la inclusión, a la vez que aborda las necesidades y realidades únicas de cada contexto.

FONDO

UNDP Argentina has contribute to the digital transformation, combining policy support, experimentation, and capacity building. Over the past few years, our Country Office, and particularly the Co_Lab, have collaborated with diverse actors—from ministries to local governments— to promote inclusive, people-centered approaches to digitalization.

Key milestones include:

Red Con Vos (since 2021): A network of nearby stores promoting digital inclusion, helping

neighbors with their online tasks, along two municipalities. Recognized by the OECD

Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, it became a reference model

adopted by other UNDP Labs. https://www.undp.org/es/argentina/proyectos/little-help-my-neighbors

AI Agenda (since 2023): The Lab has led the AI strategy  along with different stakeholders, government agencies, universities, within others, producing research, hosting public seminars, and developing tools to promote responsible, inclusive uses of AI aligned with development goals. https://inteligenciaargentina.org/en/

Internal digital strategy: Within the Country Office, we’ve launched the Digital Fitness Programme (in partnership with the Chief Digital Office) and established a Digital Task Force to strengthen team-wide digital

literacy and foster purposeful experimentation with AI, blockchain, and data-driven decision-making.

Province of Buenos Aires: In partnership with the Ministry of Community Development, we conducted a comprehensive diagnostic of citizen request systems and are now co-designing a One-Stop Digital Request Platform, addressing fragmentation and inefficiencies in public service delivery.

Comodoro Rivadavia (2025): In collaboration with Comodoro Conocimiento and the Health

Secretariat, we are developing a digital tool for HIV prevention and care, rooted in human-centered design. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to localize digital transformation and tackle public health challenges through accessible and sustainable technological solutions.

Citizen empowerment through data: The Contar con Datos challenge promotes data literacy and the use of storytelling to generate public value. The initiative fosters citizen engagement with open datasets, transforming information into insight-driven narratives that can shape public decision-making.

This track record illustrates a strategic evolution—from isolated pilot initiatives to a comprehensive digital

transformation strategy that integrates top-down institutional engagement with bottom-up experimentation alongside communities and local actors. It also highlights a growing internal demand within UNDP and among its partners for capacity building, practical tools, and long-term digital strategies.

Our current challenge is to connect, scale, and consolidate these efforts, moving beyond promising pilots toward sustainable, people-centered digital ecosystems.

Despite our commitment to digital transformation, significant gaps in digital capacity remain across the Country Office and public sector partners. The UNDP Digital Strategy 2022–2025 notes that most staff lack systematic training in coredigital skills, limiting our ability to support national efforts. This isespecially evident in areas like AI, blockchain, and user-centered digital design. As a result, many innovation initiatives stall due to limited technical follow-up. At the same time, rising internal demand for digital expertise highlights both growing awareness and the urgent need for structured capacity-building.

In the Argentine public sector, structural and systemic challenges are also reflected in quantitative evidence. A 2024 study by CIPPEC, which assessed the digital maturity of municipal governments across 23 provincial capitals, reported an average overall score of 0.55 (on a scale from 0 to 1) for digital public

services. While usability and transactional functionality received relatively higher scores—0.62 and 0.69 respectively—the average for data governance was markedly low, at just 0.34. This highlights the critical underdevelopment of strategic data management practices at the local level. The study also revealed that only two-thirds of the municipalities surveyed had established any kind of local regulatory framework for digital policy. The remaining third operated under provincial or national laws, lacking local norms to guide key areas such as artificial intelligence, data ethics, or open data strategy.

At the national level, the scale of fragmentation is equally pronounced. In 2019, the Auditor General’s Office (AGN) reported that Argentina’s federal public administration was operating with 2,781 distinct IT systems across ministries and agencies. This level of technological disintegration significantly limits interoperability, causes duplication of data and effort, and hampers both service delivery and monitoring. The shortage of technical talent further compounds these challenges. Many municipalities report chronic difficulties in recruiting and retaining professionals with expertise in areas such as programming, data analysis, and digital infrastructure. Public sector salaries are often uncompetitive, and structured training or upskilling opportunities for existing staff are scarce. Although some local governments have started to build informal partnerships with universities and tech organizations, these remain isolated efforts rather than part of a coherent national strategy.

Taken together, these quantitative indicators paint a picture of a public sector that, while increasingly aware of the need for digital transformation, still lacks the institutional scaffolding, human resources, and regulatory frameworks necessary to implement it at scale. This Action Plan is built precisely to respond to these limitations, working to close capacity gaps through a combination of internal development, strategic partnerships, and context-sensitive, people-centered innovation.



In addition to quantitative indicators, qualitative evidence gathered through fieldwork, interviews, and diagnostic processes reinforces the urgency and complexity of Argentina’s digital transformation challenges. These insights reveal not only structural and technological barriers, but also deeply rooted institutional and cultural dynamics that shape the country’s capacity to adopt and sustain digital innovation.

At the national level, research by organizations such as Fundar has shown that Argentina lacks centralized leadership for data governance and maintains no comprehensive inventory of public datasets. This results in significant ambiguity regarding which institutions produce specific data, how it is used, and under what standards. Even as transparency initiatives have led to the publication of open datasets, there are few institutional mechanisms in place to guarantee data quality, ensure interoperability, or promote strategic use. The absence of a national data strategy and formal governance frameworks severely limits the public sector’s ability to leverage information as a tool for innovation and decision-making.

These challenges are mirrored—and often magnified—at the local level. Interviews conducted by CIPPEC with municipal officials reveal a widespread lack of coordination between departments, with most operating on isolated digital systems that do not share taxonomies, data models, or workflows. In practice, this results in fragmented service delivery, where citizens are forced to repeat procedures and information cannot be efficiently reused across agencies. Municipalities also report a persistent scarcity of technical personnel, particularly in areas like data science, software development, and AI application. The difficulty in hiring and retaining talent is exacerbated by low public sector salaries, limited career development opportunities, and a lack of internal training programs. While some local governments have begun to partner with universities or the private sector to address these issues, such initiatives tend to be informal and short-term, rather than part of institutional strategies.

A concrete example of these limitations comes from the Province of Buenos Aires. Between September and November 2024, UNDP’s Accelerator Lab partnered with the Ministry of Community Development to conduct an in-depth assessment of its citizen request management system. Through interviews with front-desk staff, call center operators, social workers, request coordinators, and high-level officials, the diagnostic uncovered a highly fragmented structure. Different teams handled citizen requests independently, with little coordination, no shared protocols, and minimal use of integrated digital tools. Communication between teams often relied on informal channels such as WhatsApp or personal email accounts, raising concerns about data privacy and operational accountability. Many processes were tracked manually using outdated formats like Excel spreadsheets, making it difficult to monitor requests, follow up on unresolved issues, or analyze patterns to inform policy.

These qualitative findings reveal that Argentina’s digital gaps are not only technical, but deeply institutional and cultural. They reflect a broader need for trust-building, organizational redesign, and human-centered innovation. By grounding our action plan in this firsthand understanding of how systems actually operate, we aim to co-create digital transformation strategies that are not only technically sound, but also socially embedded and operationally sustainable.

Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
Our approach to digital transformation is rooted in a clear, people-centered value proposition: to reduce the digital divide not only by improving access to technology, but by strengthening human and institutional capacities, fostering public trust, and ensuring that digital tools are embedded in strategies that are inclusive, sustainable, and locally relevant.

Rather than treating digitalization as a purely technical challenge, we see it as a cross-cutting enabler of systemic change—one that must be shaped by local knowledge, co-created with diverse actors, and driven by the specific needs and realities of those it aims to serve. This is why our strategy combines both top-down and bottom-up approaches. At the institutional level, we work to align digital transformation with broader governance and sustainability priorities, providing governments with the tools, insights, and support needed to modernize services, enhance accountability, and strengthen resilience. At the grassroots level, we engage directly with civil society, local innovation labs, and frontline staff to co-design solutions that are both technically feasible and socially grounded.

Internally, we are building digital capacity within the UNDP Country Office through structured training programs, knowledge-sharing initiatives, and active experimentation with emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, and data science. These efforts aim to position our teams as reliable partners for government counterparts navigating their own digital transitions.

Externally, our work spans from redesigning citizen request systems in the Province of Buenos Aires, to supporting the creation of digital health tools in Comodoro Rivadavia, to promoting data literacy and civic participation through storytelling challenges like “Contar con Datos.” In each case, we combine policy expertise, service design, and inclusive innovation to produce solutions that are scalable, ethical, and responsive to real-world complexity.

It is important to highlight that we are also mindful of the other side of digitalization—the unintended consequences that can emerge in increasingly digital societies. In parallel to this action plan, through our resilience agenda, we are exploring how digital tools and platforms may exacerbate challenges such as unwanted loneliness, social fragmentation, or reduced access for those excluded from digital systems. As we promote digital transformation, we are committed to doing so responsibly—ensuring that the solutions we co-create do not deepen inequalities or create new vulnerabilities. By integrating this perspective into our work, we aim to foster a more holistic, ethical, and human-centered approach to digitalization.

Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?
Through a combination of stakeholder mapping, interviews, and participatory workshops, we gathered insights from institutional actors, frontline workers, and community members—building a more complete, experience-based evidence base. This approach helped uncover not only operational gaps, but also cultural dynamics, levels of digital literacy, and user expectations, which are often invisible in traditional assessments.

In the Province of Buenos Aires, we partnered with the Ministry of Community Development to conduct a deep diagnostic of its citizen request management system. Through interviews with senior officials, case coordinators, call center operators, social workers, and administrative staff, we identified critical fragmentation in workflows, the widespread use of informal coordination tools (such as spreadsheets, WhatsApp, or personal emails), and the absence of standardized protocols or traceability mechanisms. These insights provided a clearer understanding of the institutional barriers to digitalization, as well as the internal capacities and motivation that could be leveraged to support change.

In Comodoro Rivadavia, we are applying a similar methodology, engaging with a diverse group of municipal actors—including teams from digital government, health, gender, diversity, and social inclusion areas—alongside members of the innovation lab Comodoro Conocimiento. We are going to conduct interviews with civil society organizations and citizens to understand their experiences with access to digital services, especially in the context of sexual and reproductive health, HIV prevention, and public trust. The participatory mapping of stakeholders and systems revealed both infrastructural and relational barriers to digital access, while also highlighting opportunities for collaboration and innovation from within the local ecosystem.

Together, these new sources of data not only revealed what is not working, but also helped identify where change is already possible, and how digital transformation can be approached in ways that are more inclusive, contextualized, and human-centered.

Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
Our Country Office is already benefiting from our digital capacity-building efforts, as demonstrated by recent requests for support in drafting terms of reference related to digitalization. This growing internal demand has created opportunities to offer digital transformation initiatives to our government counterparts. Key beneficiaries of this work include the Province of Buenos Aires, where we are collaborating on systemic reforms, and Comodoro Conocimiento, a municipal innovation lab with which we are co-developing digital solutions for health services.

We also anticipate mutual value for strategic allies such as Fundación Blockchain Argentina, who bring technical expertise and could support the ethical application of emerging technologies. Additionally, the Data Science Lab at Universidad de San Andrés (UDESA) stands to benefit if we are able to expand the ecosystem by engaging private sector actors and fostering new public-private collaborations."

In our work, we have found that resilience is not a fixed trait but a dynamic process that operates across individual, relational, and structural levels—and is deeply connected to well-being. \n\nA key foundation of resilience is the ability to feel connected, to belong. When social ties are weakened or absent, people's capacity to adapt, recover, and respond to adversity is significantly diminished. Unwanted loneliness, in this sense, is not just a personal or emotional experience—it is a public health concern. It has been associated with heightened risks of cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression, and increased mortality, prompting some experts to label it a modern epidemic that requires both prevention and systemic support. \n\nThis phenomenon affects people of all ages and is driven by a complex web of factors: work-life imbalance, the absence of shared purpose or meaningful relationships, disconnection from nature, and a lack of fulfilling activities. These drivers are further compounded by technological overdependence, population aging, the long-term social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic—especially among younger populations—precarious labor conditions, shifting family dynamics, substance abuse, social pressure, and ageist narratives. \n\nOne thing is clear: we need to build community and think locally. Our challenge is to design policies that strengthen social connection and enhance both individual and collective capacities for resilience. "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": true, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Challenge statement: What is your challenge?

Communities possess valuable knowledge about their environments and the opportunities they offer in times of crisis (UNDP, 2022a). Collective intelligence —through the open and structured exchange of ideas— presents a powerful opportunity to recover, amplify, and apply this knowledge. This collaborative approach can foster enabling conditions for resilience. That’s why our AccLab is exploring how people directly affected by challenges respond to them, aiming to understand the adaptive strategies they use and the conditions that either support or constrain their ability to respond effectively. \n\nSince 2023, the AccLab has been working on resilience in different ways, addressing a range of interconnected challenges through three qualitative research projects and one collective intelligence initiative. \n\nThe first began as a research collaboration with the Human Development and Policy Programme, focused on understanding what drives certain young people in Argentina to engage in activism for sustainable development. This work, based on 33 interviews, revealed clear links between activism and resilience: for many, activism serves not only as a response to adversity but also as a pathway to building personal and collective strength. \n\nThe second initiative was part of a regional research effort led by the UNDP Latin America and Caribbean Bureau (RBLAC), aimed at analyzing the relationship between risk, individual resilience, and human development. The goal was to explore how people’s experiences and coping strategies shape their ability to adapt to the economic, social, environmental, and governance challenges present in the region. From Argentina, we contributed 18 in-depth interviews in 2024, and the findings will be published and shared in 2025. \n\nThe findings highlight that, although not always named explicitly, resilience is closely tied to the pursuit of well-being and is expressed through adaptive strategies across individual, relational, and structural levels. Core themes include the importance of mental health, fulfilling activities, and social and family support, as well as skepticism toward institutions and the need for effective state responses. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified feelings of disconnection and uncertainty, accelerating digitization while also revealing new vulnerabilities. Despite this, participants shared hopeful views of risk as an opportunity for transformation, linking resilience to creativity, autonomy, and future aspirations. The study identifies four key dimensions shaping resilience: mental health, the ambivalence of digitization, the value of community-based responses, and the demand for meaningful institutional action. At the heart of these findings lies a call to address disconnection—within oneself, with others, with nature, and with political leadership—making unwanted loneliness a relevant and timely area for further exploration and policy innovation. \n\nThe third initiative involved a solutions mapping exercise on access to justice for persons with disabilities, as part of a UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund initiative in collaboration with UNDP Argentina’s Democratic Governance cluster, UNICEF, WHO/PAHO, OHCHR, UNFPA, and UNHCR. We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with people with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities and their families in the City and Province of Buenos Aires.  \n\nOur findings show that individuals with disabilities and their families face a persistent web of interrelated barriers—ranging from socioeconomic challenges and limited access to clear information, to complex and often dehumanizing bureaucratic procedures, social stigma, and exclusion from education, employment, and community life. In response, they engage in a gradual and dynamic process of specialization, often beginning with solitary, self-directed efforts that evolve into deeper knowledge and more effective advocacy for their rights. This journey blends individual and collective learning, demanding significant emotional investment, strategic adjustments, and mutual support—ultimately fostering resilience across multiple levels. Networks of people with disabilities, civil society organizations, and informal groups play a vital role in this ecosystem, providing not only practical tools and guidance but also emotional support, solidarity, and safe spaces for empowerment that enable individuals and families to navigate systems and assert their rights more confidently. \n\nAdditionally, in partnership with the Uruguay River Binational Project and local authorities in Concepción (Province of Entre Ríos), we launched a collective intelligence initiative to co-develop action plans for protecting native plant species and eradicating invasive ones. This experience highlighted the importance of citizen participation and local knowledge in building environmental resilience and strengthening community engagement. \n\nOur main R&amp;D focus for 2025 emerged from conversations with a local government with whom the AccLab is likely to collaborate. Together, we identified unwanted loneliness as a shared area of concern. Increasingly recognized as a public health issue, unwanted loneliness is often referred to as a modern epidemic—one that demands not only targeted interventions but also preventive and community-based responses. In this context, the involvement of local communities is essential to designing effective and contextually relevant solutions. "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

Consequently, feelings of insecurity are rising across the globe [Figure 2].\n\nIn this uncertain context, where many people are experiencing distress, the focus on unwanted loneliness emerges as a timely and relevant issue—one with the potential to grow in importance and impact. Unwanted loneliness is a subjective, unwelcome feeling of lack or loss of companionship, which happens when we have a mismatch between the quantity and quality of social relationships that we have, and those that we want. It is often associated with social isolation, but people can and do feel lonely even when in a relationship or when surrounded by others.\n\nLoneliness affects people of all ages and from all backgrounds – from the school child who struggles to make friends, to the new parent coping alone, to the older person who has outlived her friends and immediate family. Feelings of loneliness affect us all at some point, but being lonely can become a serious problem when it becomes chronic – a day to-day reality which, over time, can grind us down, affecting our health and wellbeing and damaging our ability to connect with others.\n\nOver the years, studies on loneliness have reached different conclusions about the levels and overall distribution of loneliness across the UK and among different groups. Studies have found relatively consistent levels of chronic loneliness among older people – with between five and 15 per cent reporting that they are often or always lonely. However, we have much less robust data on loneliness among children, young people and adults of working age.\n\nSome recent surveys have uncovered levels of loneliness across all ages that are worryingly high. What we don’t yet know is if this is a sign of a growing problem, or because efforts to breakdown the stigma of loneliness are working, making people more willing to acknowledge their loneliness. Whichever it is, there is much to do (European Commission, 2018).\n\nThe most relevant factors associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing loneliness include, having a low level of education, living in incomplete nuclear or single-person households, perceiving financial hardship (feeling their income is insufficient), facing functional health limitations, lacking social support networks, not participating in formal or informal activities, not working, and not using the internet (GCBA, 2019)  "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""9ca8bdba-cf1b-48fd-872f-b019d0d5fb74"", ""src"": null, ""html"": """", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""left"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""787c2c8d-8751-44ca-b0f9-1206428a4afd"", ""name"": null, ""srcs"": [""uploads/3080f46d-45ec-4adb-99a0-25f2bf2ec578/4f8c0a94229ac87a73537d8fc09aa9fe.png"", ""uploads/3080f46d-45ec-4adb-99a0-25f2bf2ec578/b7774f981abbd6ae583fc7b120bcc083.png"", ""uploads/3080f46d-45ec-4adb-99a0-25f2bf2ec578/1e2d170107959c83ba12d103da487133.png""], ""type"": ""mosaic"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """", ""verticalalign"": ""start""}]], ""level"": ""media"", ""structure"": [{""id"": ""45c2f1c7-0640-4562-89b5-c541ae3e8a56"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""is_excerpt"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""9ca8bdba-cf1b-48fd-872f-b019d0d5fb74"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""5b0edd22-f7cc-4d9c-9f6b-2ac95cf86bae"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}], ""instruction"": ""Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge?

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is to address both individual and collective resilience, which is threatened by unwanted loneliness—an increasingly widespread phenomenon—in a world marked by growing uncertainty, economic instability, and complex social dynamics and environmental pressures. In our work, we have found that resilience is not a fixed trait but a dynamic process that operates across individual, relational, and structural levels—and is deeply connected to well-being. 

A key foundation of resilience is the ability to feel connected, to belong. When social ties are weakened or absent, people's capacity to adapt, recover, and respond to adversity is significantly diminished. Unwanted loneliness, in this sense, is not just a personal or emotional experience—it is a public health concern. It has been associated with heightened risks of cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression, and increased mortality, prompting some experts to label it a modern epidemic that requires both prevention and systemic support. 

This phenomenon affects people of all ages and is driven by a complex web of factors: work-life imbalance, the absence of shared purpose or meaningful relationships, disconnection from nature, and a lack of fulfilling activities. These drivers are further compounded by technological overdependence, population aging, the long-term social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic—especially among younger populations—precarious labor conditions, shifting family dynamics, substance abuse, social pressure, and ageist narratives. 

One thing is clear: we need to build community and think locally. Our challenge is to design policies that strengthen social connection and enhance both individual and collective capacities for resilience.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Building resilience through solidarity and shared purpose has emerged as a key strategy in a global context defined by uncertainty. Communities possess valuable knowledge about their environments and the opportunities they offer in times of crisis (UNDP, 2022a). Collective intelligence —through the open and structured exchange of ideas— presents a powerful opportunity to recover, amplify, and apply this knowledge. This collaborative approach can foster enabling conditions for resilience. That’s why our AccLab is exploring how people directly affected by challenges respond to them, aiming to understand the adaptive strategies they use and the conditions that either support or constrain their ability to respond effectively. 

Since 2023, the AccLab has been working on resilience in different ways, addressing a range of interconnected challenges through three qualitative research projects and one collective intelligence initiative. 

The first began as a research collaboration with the Human Development and Policy Programme, focused on understanding what drives certain young people in Argentina to engage in activism for sustainable development. This work, based on 33 interviews, revealed clear links between activism and resilience: for many, activism serves not only as a response to adversity but also as a pathway to building personal and collective strength. 

The second initiative was part of a regional research effort led by the UNDP Latin America and Caribbean Bureau (RBLAC), aimed at analyzing the relationship between risk, individual resilience, and human development. The goal was to explore how people’s experiences and coping strategies shape their ability to adapt to the economic, social, environmental, and governance challenges present in the region. From Argentina, we contributed 18 in-depth interviews in 2024, and the findings will be published and shared in 2025. 

The findings highlight that, although not always named explicitly, resilience is closely tied to the pursuit of well-being and is expressed through adaptive strategies across individual, relational, and structural levels. Core themes include the importance of mental health, fulfilling activities, and social and family support, as well as skepticism toward institutions and the need for effective state responses. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified feelings of disconnection and uncertainty, accelerating digitization while also revealing new vulnerabilities. Despite this, participants shared hopeful views of risk as an opportunity for transformation, linking resilience to creativity, autonomy, and future aspirations. The study identifies four key dimensions shaping resilience: mental health, the ambivalence of digitization, the value of community-based responses, and the demand for meaningful institutional action. At the heart of these findings lies a call to address disconnection—within oneself, with others, with nature, and with political leadership—making unwanted loneliness a relevant and timely area for further exploration and policy innovation. 

The third initiative involved a solutions mapping exercise on access to justice for persons with disabilities, as part of a UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund initiative in collaboration with UNDP Argentina’s Democratic Governance cluster, UNICEF, WHO/PAHO, OHCHR, UNFPA, and UNHCR. We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with people with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities and their families in the City and Province of Buenos Aires.  

Our findings show that individuals with disabilities and their families face a persistent web of interrelated barriers—ranging from socioeconomic challenges and limited access to clear information, to complex and often dehumanizing bureaucratic procedures, social stigma, and exclusion from education, employment, and community life. In response, they engage in a gradual and dynamic process of specialization, often beginning with solitary, self-directed efforts that evolve into deeper knowledge and more effective advocacy for their rights. This journey blends individual and collective learning, demanding significant emotional investment, strategic adjustments, and mutual support—ultimately fostering resilience across multiple levels. Networks of people with disabilities, civil society organizations, and informal groups play a vital role in this ecosystem, providing not only practical tools and guidance but also emotional support, solidarity, and safe spaces for empowerment that enable individuals and families to navigate systems and assert their rights more confidently. 

Additionally, in partnership with the Uruguay River Binational Project and local authorities in Concepción (Province of Entre Ríos), we launched a collective intelligence initiative to co-develop action plans for protecting native plant species and eradicating invasive ones. This experience highlighted the importance of citizen participation and local knowledge in building environmental resilience and strengthening community engagement. 

Our main R&amp;D focus for 2025 emerged from conversations with a local government with whom the AccLab is likely to collaborate. Together, we identified unwanted loneliness as a shared area of concern. Increasingly recognized as a public health issue, unwanted loneliness is often referred to as a modern epidemic—one that demands not only targeted interventions but also preventive and community-based responses. In this context, the involvement of local communities is essential to designing effective and contextually relevant solutions.

The complex interplay of various insecurity factors is becoming more evident. 

These acute crises are giving way to chronic,  interconnected uncertainties on a global scale, creating a sense of unsettled lives and an uncertain future (2022a) [Figure 1]. Consequently, feelings of insecurity are rising across the globe [Figure 2].

In this uncertain context, where many people are experiencing distress, the focus on unwanted loneliness emerges as a timely and relevant issue—one with the potential to grow in importance and impact. Unwanted loneliness is a subjective, unwelcome feeling of lack or loss of companionship, which happens when we have a mismatch between the quantity and quality of social relationships that we have, and those that we want. It is often associated with social isolation, but people can and do feel lonely even when in a relationship or when surrounded by others.

Loneliness affects people of all ages and from all backgrounds – from the school child who struggles to make friends, to the new parent coping alone, to the older person who has outlived her friends and immediate family. Feelings of loneliness affect us all at some point, but being lonely can become a serious problem when it becomes chronic – a day to-day reality which, over time, can grind us down, affecting our health and wellbeing and damaging our ability to connect with others.

Over the years, studies on loneliness have reached different conclusions about the levels and overall distribution of loneliness across the UK and among different groups. Studies have found relatively consistent levels of chronic loneliness among older people – with between five and 15 per cent reporting that they are often or always lonely. However, we have much less robust data on loneliness among children, young people and adults of working age.

Some recent surveys have uncovered levels of loneliness across all ages that are worryingly high. What we don’t yet know is if this is a sign of a growing problem, or because efforts to breakdown the stigma of loneliness are working, making people more willing to acknowledge their loneliness. Whichever it is, there is much to do (European Commission, 2018).

The most relevant factors associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing loneliness include, having a low level of education, living in incomplete nuclear or single-person households, perceiving financial hardship (feeling their income is insufficient), facing functional health limitations, lacking social support networks, not participating in formal or informal activities, not working, and not using the internet (GCBA, 2019)



We mapped 69 international initiatives addressing unwanted loneliness. Several key patterns emerged:

• They adopt a community-centered approach, fostering social connection through networks, cultural activities, and the use of public spaces.

• They promote intergenerational exchange, strengthening learning and solidarity across age groups.

• They integrate urban planning strategies, designing public spaces that encourage interaction, ensure accessibility, and include green areas that promote well-being and a sense of belonging.

• They leverage digital tools to support learning, civic engagement, and inclusion—tailored to the sociodemographic profile and specific needs of the target population. While digital solutions cannot replace physical contact, they can be especially relevant in low-density areas or for individuals with limited mobility. Some initiatives also focus on reducing excessive screen time and mitigating the negative effects of overdependence on technology.

• While a few countries have developed national action plans, many of the most impactful responses are local. Municipalities often lead the way, as the core resource for addressing unwanted loneliness lies in creating—and strengthening—community networks.

Strong collaboration across governments, civil society, and the private sector is critical to scaling these efforts and amplifying their impact. At its core, this line of work is about creating the conditions for people to feel connected, supported, and empowered—laying the groundwork for more resilient communities.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The AccLab brings a unique value proposition grounded in its extensive experience developing collaborative strategies with governments and civil society organizations, engaging local communities, and prioritizing community participation. The AccLab has also demonstrated a strong ability to identify and elevate underexplored topics—such as citizen science—supporting their growth into areas of broader relevance. We believe that unwanted loneliness, which we aim to address in partnership with a local government recognized for its innovation efforts, holds similar potential.

Unwanted loneliness is becoming an increasingly relevant phenomenon, offering fertile ground for identifying emerging signals of change, mapping diverse types of solutions, and experimenting with new approaches. However, at this initial stage, the AccLab will focus on raising awareness of the issue, providing technical assistance, and generating evidence-based insights to inform public management. The AccLab’s approach—focused on user-center design, collective intelligence, etc.—positions it uniquely within the UNDP ecosystem to explore this challenge and generate valuable learnings that can be scaled or adapted in other contexts.

Please state the name of the partner:
Local government

What sector does our partner belong to?
Government (&amp;related)

Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.
The AccLab with a local government from Argentina are considering collaborating on an initiative to measure unwanted loneliness through a strategic and participatory approach. Before data collection begins, the AccLab proposes a preliminary diagnosis and workshops with municipal officials to provide conceptual inputs and strengthen the methodological strategy.

This diagnosis will systematize key discussions, map international initiatives, and explore measurement tools. The workshops will raise awareness of the issue, foster a shared vision, and facilitate agreements for the use of the evidence generated by the initiative. Additionally, the AccLab will support the methodological design by combining qualitative and quantitative approaches, promote data visualization, and provide technical assistance in interventions, collective intelligence exercises, and impact monitoring.

Learning questions

Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?
How can public policy address unwanted loneliness not only as a wicked problem, but as a systemic challenge that threatens resilience and well-being in rapidly changing and uncertain environments?

To work on this challenge —and building on the research lines we’ve already developed— we need to understand how unwanted loneliness manifests among the two key populations our R&amp;D line will focus on: youth and older adults. We are particularly interested in identifying early signals, mapping existing solutions, and exploring how local governments can play a catalytic role in fostering social connection and collective resilience.

Our Lab is exploring how people who are directly affected by challenges deal with them, seeking to understand the adaptive strategies they deploy and the conditions that support or hinder their capacity to respond.

To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?
The first phase of our research on unwanted loneliness focused on solutions mapping, with the aim of identifying and systematizing various initiatives implemented around the world to address this issue. This process allowed us to recognize common patterns—such as community-based approaches, intergenerational exchange, urban planning, digital inclusion, municipal-level interventions, and cross-sector partnerships—as well as to identify the groups most affected. As a result, we now have a portfolio of solutions that could potentially be adapted, replicated or scaled.

As we move forward in formalizing our partnership with the local government, we plan to develop a sensemaking strategy as part of our approach. This strategy will help build a systemic understanding of unwanted loneliness, surface shared narratives, and identify the social, cultural, and institutional factors influencing the phenomenon. It will also foster a common understanding of how loneliness manifests locally. To this end, we will organize high-level workshops with public officials to place the issue on the policy agenda and explore how various lines of government work—such as state modernization, urban planning, and public health—can impact unwanted loneliness. We also aim to triangulate qualitative and quantitative methods, involving diverse stakeholders to enrich and validate our understanding of the phenomenon.

In parallel, through participatory design, we aim to promote the evaluation, co-creation, and/or testing of solutions with a variety of stakeholders. The goal is to ensure that proposed interventions effectively respond to people’s real needs, can be adapted to specific contexts, and are sustainable over time.

Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?
The AccLab has been working across multiple dimensions of resilience, recognizing that the feeling of being connected to others is a key component of people’s ability to adapt and thrive. Building on this line of work, unwanted loneliness remains a largely underexplored issue at the different national levels in Argentina. The data generated through this R&amp;D initiative will shed light on a challenge that has received limited attention from policymakers, offering both evidence and possibly momentum to elevate it on the public agenda.

The goal is not only to understand the scope of the problem in a specific local context—which could serve as a starting point to expand the research more broadly—but also to explore how people experience unwanted loneliness and what helps them navigate it. By centering their voices through in-depth, semi-structured interviews—some of which may adopt a life history approach—as well as through on-the-ground observations, we will gather insights.

In parallel, a solutions mapping exercise will help address a critical knowledge gap around practical, context-sensitive responses to this wicked problem. Analyzing these data sources will generate valuable insights that can inform future initiatives, which must be tailored to the local reality. This evidence will be crucial for designing culturally relevant, technically sound, and people-centered interventions.

Together, these methods will contribute to a more comprehensive and multidimensional understanding of resilience—one that highlights not only the challenges individuals and communities face, but also their agency—. Also, they will surface innovative practices that can inform future experimentation and policy design, bridging the gap between lived experience and systemic response.

Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
Resilience is one of the cornerstone Signature Solutions championed by UNDP at the global level. In this context, the contributions of the AccLab can enrich both public and organizational discussions through an R&amp;D approach that generates locally grounded insights—such as the lived experiences of individuals and groups—that can resonate with diverse stakeholders.

Moreover, this R&amp;D line is supported by a partnership with a local government that has expressed strong interest in addressing unwanted loneliness, making the potential for growth and impact both feasible and timely. The initiative will combine knowledge generation for action, collective intelligence exercises, consensus-building among diverse actors, and the design, evaluation, and adaptation of innovative interventions aimed at informing public policies that strengthen social connection and enhance individual and collective capacities for resilience."

Challenge statement

Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.

BIG BET

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that tourism locations along the Kwanza river require development and promotion, since there is an increasing interest from African American communities in visiting these historical sites. There is a need to mobilize resources in partnership with the Ministry of Tourism.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The town of Massangano, in the province of Cuanza Norte, has great historical relevance for Angola. Located at the confluence of the Cuanza and Lucala rivers, it has potential for cultural and ecological tourism, connecting with pre-colonial heritage and the slave trade. The site includes historic monuments, and there are efforts to preserve and enhance the heritage, with the potential to make it a key tourist destination. Historical evidence reveals a direct connection between early African-American families and records of enslaved individuals who trace their origins to Angola. Massangano was an important departure point for those who were taken to the Americas. In 1619, the first Africans from Angola arrived on the shores of Hampton Roads. It is estimated that over 12 million Americans in the United States are of Angolan descent. The Tucker family is descended from the first Africans enslaved in North America. The William Tucker 1624 Society intends to continue collaborating with the Government of Angola in various areas. Promoting tourism with a focus on Afro-descendant culture in Angola can be a gateway to strengthening international cooperation and community development.

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
BIG BET

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that disposable diapers are mismanaged in the country. 94% of babies in the country exclusively uses single use diapers (UNDP &amp;EEA, 2023), yet only 17% of households have access to waste management services (Census, 2017). This leads to people, particularly in non-urban areas failing to manage their diaper waste in an environmentally sound manner as shown by about 83% of households in the country depending mostly on the open burning of waste as a disposal method, yet there are limited sustainable alternatives locally.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Data from a previous UNDP AccLab and Eswatini Environment Authority (EEA) experiment in 2023 showed that while sustainable alternatives like re-usable diapers are available in the market, these are in limited supply in the country and awareness on them is quite low with caregivers. This experiment also showed a willingness for mothers to transition towards these alternatives. The same study showed that willingness to pay among mothers and caregivers was a lower that market prices, at E60 ($3) per nappy compared to the market price ranging between E146 ($8)  and E173 ($10) per nappy. Municipal councils are also reluctant to collect this type of waste as it significantly reduces the lifespan of landfills. An innovation challenge undertaken as part of this experiment did not yield any useful results in terms of managing single use diaper waste, hence a need to deal with this type of waste upstream. This challenge is driven by the fact that most babis in the country exclusively use diapers without having access to proper waste management systems such as waste collection services and disposal and/ or recycling mechanisms. 
Stakeholders involved in this challenges include: communities, caregivers, municipalities, EEA, Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Ministry of Health, Ministry Tinkhundla Administration and Development, Ministry of Finance, Eswatini Revenue Service, Retailers. 
undesired effects include: a. aesthetic value of communities is degraded; b. the dumping of diaper waste causes the threat of releasing pathogens and contaminants into the environment, particularly waterways, thereby threatening human health and aquatic life; c. the open burning diaper waste also emits contaminants into the air; d. disposable nappy waste takes a lot of landfill space, thus proving to be expensive to manage using this method; e. diaper waste is also ingested by livestock which can lead to death and rejection by the market, thus affecting community livelihoods, especially for rural communities who depend on livestock farming.

There is a lack of awareness of sustainable, cost-effective and user friendly alternatives locally. There is also limited supply and/ or availability of these alternative. Additionally, the up-front costs of these alternatives are high. There is also inadequate access to proper waste disposal mechanisms.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
This initiative focuses on upstream management of diapers contrary to the usual (government) approach of dealing with disposal of single use diaper waste. Our approach also focuses on mapping other unusual approaches besides management of waste post-facto. This experiment also wants to explore incentivizing environmentally friendly alternatives. 
Why us: The AccLab focuses on mapping solutions and experimenting with new and/ or untested ideas for dealing with challenges to provide evidence to these other actors for uptake and scaling. Additionally, government's approach to waste management has generally been linear ( produce-use-dispose) and the Lab is trying to bring in circularity. although on paper, the issue of waste avoidance is there, it is not there in practice, hence the lab is experimenting to provide evidence to government on the opportunities for circular waste management. 
Why its worth Investment: There are a number of direct and indirect costs on government because of mismanagement of diaper waste (i.e. on health, on water treatment, waste management, tourism, flood damage management). By investing in this work, these costs will be minimised or avoided.

This builds on AccLabs understanding that there is an untapped wealth of relevant knowledge and perspectives in collective intelligence that should be considered in the development and regulation of frontier technologies at the global level.\nThe challenge statements on the 4 dialogues are not set in stone but some early drafts are on the following topics:\n1.

The rapid diffusion of these innovations often outstrips the ability of policymakers to regulate effectively, integrate them into governance structures, and anticipate their societal impact. This challenge is driven by a combination of factors, including limited institutional capacity, fragmented policy frameworks, and a lack of structured cross-sector dialogue between government, private sector innovators, academia, and civil society.\nIn North Macedonia, as in many other countries, regulatory frameworks remain reactive rather than anticipatory, creating governance gaps that hinder both responsible innovation and equitable access to emerging technologies. In addition, there are specific EU accession related transpositions of EU laws/ or approximations needed. Key challenges include a slow adaptation of legal and ethical standards, insufficient digital skills among policymakers, and underdeveloped mechanisms for citizen engagement in tech governance. As a result, technological advancements often lead to regulatory blind spots, ethical dilemmas, and unequal distribution of benefits, exacerbating digital divides and limiting the potential of emerging technologies to drive inclusive development. Addressing these issues requires forward-looking strategies, multi-stakeholder engagement, and adaptive governance models that enable policymakers to respond proactively to technological change.\n\n\n"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

However, differences in infrastructure, digital literacy, data ecosystems, and regulatory environments still create disparities in how effectively countries can harness its potential. The AccLab team spearheaded the process of preparation of the Digital Readiness Assessment DRA for North Macedonia in 2023. Post DRA, the team organized two discussions with larger group of stakeholders where two key findings were elaborated. One digital literacy and two digital transformations in business, particularly for MSME. Both of these discussions and the DRA highlighted that digital transformation is lacking behind in a couple of areas such as skills, both in general and public, and administration.  There are specialized talent in the country in specific emerging tech fields such as AI, gaming, blockchain where our hypothesis is that these people can be the enablers for smoother digital transformation using Gen AI. Gen AI is expected to influence the talent, products, services etc. \n\n\n\n"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""9ca8bdba-cf1b-48fd-872f-b019d0d5fb74"", ""src"": null, ""html"": ""n/a"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""left"", ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""5b0edd22-f7cc-4d9c-9f6b-2ac95cf86bae"", ""src"": ""uploads/86d92d94-4314-4314-bcf3-f1592ea08de9/6e79beb1d56b0e8f99b90d601a2364ee.png"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""scale"": ""original"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""center"", ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}]], ""level"": ""media"", ""structure"": [{""id"": ""45c2f1c7-0640-4562-89b5-c541ae3e8a56"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""is_excerpt"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""9ca8bdba-cf1b-48fd-872f-b019d0d5fb74"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""5b0edd22-f7cc-4d9c-9f6b-2ac95cf86bae"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}], ""instruction"": ""Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge?

Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
BIG BET

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Challenge statement: Our challenge is that “voices” of people, experts, and decision-makers—on emerging frontier technologies such as AI are often overlooked in development and policymaking. With this intervention and thoroughly developed methodologies we want to create 4 dialogues where these voices can surface on the perceived benefits and risks related to the development and deployment of these technologies. This builds on AccLabs understanding that there is an untapped wealth of relevant knowledge and perspectives in collective intelligence that should be considered in the development and regulation of frontier technologies at the global level.
The challenge statements on the 4 dialogues are not set in stone but some early drafts are on the following topics:
1. GenAI in education in N. Macedonia / Leveraging leverage AI for innovation in education while maintaining ethical safeguards.
2. AI Developments - Governance and Tech
3. How technology affects information integrity in North Macedonia?
4. TBD

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
As emerging technologies rapidly evolve—ranging from artificial intelligence and blockchain to digital platforms and automation—governments worldwide, including North Macedonia, face significant challenges in keeping pace. The rapid diffusion of these innovations often outstrips the ability of policymakers to regulate effectively, integrate them into governance structures, and anticipate their societal impact. This challenge is driven by a combination of factors, including limited institutional capacity, fragmented policy frameworks, and a lack of structured cross-sector dialogue between government, private sector innovators, academia, and civil society.
In North Macedonia, as in many other countries, regulatory frameworks remain reactive rather than anticipatory, creating governance gaps that hinder both responsible innovation and equitable access to emerging technologies. In addition, there are specific EU accession related transpositions of EU laws/ or approximations needed. Key challenges include a slow adaptation of legal and ethical standards, insufficient digital skills among policymakers, and underdeveloped mechanisms for citizen engagement in tech governance. As a result, technological advancements often lead to regulatory blind spots, ethical dilemmas, and unequal distribution of benefits, exacerbating digital divides and limiting the potential of emerging technologies to drive inclusive development. Addressing these issues requires forward-looking strategies, multi-stakeholder engagement, and adaptive governance models that enable policymakers to respond proactively to technological change.

Unlike previous technological and industrial revolutions where high-income countries had a significant head start, with emerging technologies of the 21st century the playing field is more leveled at least in terms of access. However, differences in infrastructure, digital literacy, data ecosystems, and regulatory environments still create disparities in how effectively countries can harness its potential. The AccLab team spearheaded the process of preparation of the Digital Readiness Assessment DRA for North Macedonia in 2023. Post DRA, the team organized two discussions with larger group of stakeholders where two key findings were elaborated. One digital literacy and two digital transformations in business, particularly for MSME. Both of these discussions and the DRA highlighted that digital transformation is lacking behind in a couple of areas such as skills, both in general and public, and administration.  There are specialized talent in the country in specific emerging tech fields such as AI, gaming, blockchain where our hypothesis is that these people can be the enablers for smoother digital transformation using Gen AI. Gen AI is expected to influence the talent, products, services etc.

McKinsey Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value in the previous years. As
McKinsey 72% of organizations worldwide have adopted AI, marking a significant increase from previous years.

The International Monetary Fund's AI Preparedness Index reveals stark contrasts between advanced economies, where the average index is  0.68 to Emerging market economies with 0.46 and low- income countries with Low-income countries: 0.32

Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
Unlike the other units in our CO who are more focused on implementation of digitalization we are more focused on sensemaking on the emerging technologies and what they will mean to both development work and the future of our society . With this dialogues we will be working for the first time with some stakeholders and that is why we are branding this as a big bet.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
With Emerging technologies all countries start at the same line—but who wins the race depends on governance, digital readiness, and inclusivity. How can we ensure no one is left behind? #ET4Development #FrontierTech

A critical challenge is the lack of formal systems for solid waste management, which is more pronounced in informal settlements. Additionally, there is a scarcity of dedicated areas for recycling material drop-off, and the absence of a governmental garbage removal system exacerbates the situation. Furthermore, the cooperative movement in Zanzibar has experienced periods of decline, particularly after the Cooperative Union of Tanzania underwent reforms in 1991, leading to weakened organizational and support structures. ​ijcrar.com+1academia.edu+1zanzibarinsiderbuzz.wordpress.comsemanticscholar.org\n\nThe current situation is characterized by inefficient waste collection, improper disposal methods, and limited recycling activities. This inefficiency contributes to environmental pollution, posing health risks to the community and diminishing the aesthetic appeal of the islands, which can adversely affect tourism—a vital component of Zanzibar's economy. Moreover, the lack of financial literacy and business knowledge among cooperative members hinders the development of sustainable waste management enterprises, limiting income-generating opportunities and economic growth within these communities.​\n\nAddressing these challenges necessitates a comprehensive approach that includes capacity-building initiatives, infrastructure development, and policy support to empower these cooperatives.

Grassroots initiatives, such as the crowdmapping of informal urban infrastructure, aim to improve waste management, reflecting a growing community recognition of the problem's severity.\n\nSources"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1.1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""aea972c1-0eb8-4b0b-87cf-fb394c246bf8"", ""src"": null, ""html"": """", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""left"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""6fca277f-9fb1-428a-b2f1-91cd42f51981"", ""src"": ""uploads/4212345e-900b-49e5-8ce7-a185815eb026/8fcc8461abbbd3d7ac7e986eb80fe59f.png"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""scale"": ""original"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""center"", ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}]], ""level"": ""media"", ""structure"": [{""id"": ""ac86f88e-6d60-432b-828f-b849c40a7b2d"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""is_excerpt"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""aea972c1-0eb8-4b0b-87cf-fb394c246bf8"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""6fca277f-9fb1-428a-b2f1-91cd42f51981"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}], ""instruction"": ""Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency?

EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
​Our challenge is that the community-based recycling cooperatives in Zanzibar lack adequate training, equipment, financial literacy, and business acumen, particularly in plastic recycling. This hinders their capacity to manage waste effectively and operate sustainable enterprises. Additionally, there is a general lack of knowledge and misconceptions surrounding cooperatives in Zanzibar, leading to inefficiencies and underperformance. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving waste management practices and enhancing the livelihoods of cooperative members.​

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
​The community-based recycling cooperatives in Zanzibar have emerged in response to escalating waste management challenges, particularly due to rapid urbanization and a booming tourism industry. Historically, Zanzibar has grappled with inadequate formal waste management systems, especially in informal settlements, leading to environmental degradation and health hazards. In an effort to address these issues, grassroots initiatives have formed cooperatives to manage waste more effectively and create sustainable livelihoods.​academia.edu+1ijcrar.com+1

However, these cooperatives face significant obstacles that impede their effectiveness. A critical challenge is the lack of formal systems for solid waste management, which is more pronounced in informal settlements. Additionally, there is a scarcity of dedicated areas for recycling material drop-off, and the absence of a governmental garbage removal system exacerbates the situation. Furthermore, the cooperative movement in Zanzibar has experienced periods of decline, particularly after the Cooperative Union of Tanzania underwent reforms in 1991, leading to weakened organizational and support structures. ​ijcrar.com+1academia.edu+1zanzibarinsiderbuzz.wordpress.comsemanticscholar.org

The current situation is characterized by inefficient waste collection, improper disposal methods, and limited recycling activities. This inefficiency contributes to environmental pollution, posing health risks to the community and diminishing the aesthetic appeal of the islands, which can adversely affect tourism—a vital component of Zanzibar's economy. Moreover, the lack of financial literacy and business knowledge among cooperative members hinders the development of sustainable waste management enterprises, limiting income-generating opportunities and economic growth within these communities.​

Addressing these challenges necessitates a comprehensive approach that includes capacity-building initiatives, infrastructure development, and policy support to empower these cooperatives. Enhancing their operational efficiency and sustainability is crucial for improving waste management practices and fostering socio-economic development in Zanzibar.

​Zanzibar has implemented several initiatives to enhance solid waste management and promote sustainable development. In 2019, the Zanzibar Urban Municipal Council (ZUMC), in collaboration with the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), introduced the Urban Municipal Council Solid Waste Management Regulations. These regulations, the first of their kind in East Africa, are based on the 'Polluter Pays Principle' and aim to improve waste management practices across the island. Building on decentralized waste management pilot projects, such as the successful implementation in Shaurimoyo, these regulations emphasize waste segregation at the source and community involvement. Furthering its commitment to sustainable development, Zanzibar launched the Zanzibar Development Plan (ZADEP) 2021–2026, focusing on the Blue Economy for inclusive growth. This plan includes objectives to implement a National Waste Management Plan and establish dedicated waste disposal areas. These efforts align with Tanzania's broader strategies, as outlined in the Third National Development Plan 2021/22–2025/26, which emphasizes sustainable waste management and environmental conservation. Collectively, these initiatives reflect Zanzibar's proactive approach to addressing waste management challenges and promoting environmental sustainability.​



Recent developments in Zanzibar's waste management landscape underscore the urgency of addressing systemic inefficiencies. The island's ambition to become the world's first Zero Waste archipelago, marked by the launch of a Zero Waste implementation in Unguja on March 4th, 2024, highlights a critical need for sustainable waste management solutions. However, the absence of dedicated recycling drop-off points and a governmental garbage removal system has led to widespread littering across villages, beaches, and roadsides, posing serious health concerns. Grassroots initiatives, such as the crowdmapping of informal urban infrastructure, aim to improve waste management, reflecting a growing community recognition of the problem's severity.

Designed under a collaboration between Taka ni Ajira Foundation, UNDP Accelerator Lab, and Jubilee Insurance, the project sought to give rubbish pickers financial protection, social security, and better working circumstances. Taka Bima has shown success in improving financial resilience among waste pickers since its founding by providing reasonably priced insurance coverage catered to their demand (UNDP, 2023).\n\nBuilding on this success, the emphasis now is on expanding Taka Bima to Dodoma, the political capital of Tanzania, where the waste management ecology differs greatly from Tanga. Unlike Tanga, where well-organized garbage aggregation systems exist, Dodoma's waste industry stays mostly unorganized with scattered collecting and disposal methods. Financial fragility, limited insurance awareness, legal restrictions, and scalability issues all drive this difficulty (Taka ni Ajira Foundation, 2024). Dodoma's waste pickers are typically not financially literate and are reluctant to take insurance since they view it as unreliable or difficult. Furthermore, the lack of organized garbage cooperatives raises questions regarding the long-term viability of the project since it makes collective premium payments challenging.\n\nMoreover, institutional and legal obstacles impede fit into current social protection systems. Although the Tanzanian government has underlined financial inclusion via policies such the National Financial Inclusion Framework (NFIF) 2018–2022, informal workers are mostly left out of official insurance schemes (Bank of Tanzania, 2022). Adapting Taka Bima to this new terrain will depend critically on the Dodoma Municipal Council, local rubbish collectors, and financial institutions as well as on other factors.\n\nDodoma's waste pickers work without any kind of financial protection right now, which causes unstable income, poor access to healthcare, and dangerous working circumstances. A sudden medical emergency or accident might cause great financial difficulty, therefore aggravating poverty and economic uncertainty. Since they remain outside municipal garbage policies and official labor systems, the lack of insurance further reduces their negotiating strength. Furthermore, mistrust of official financial services implies that many waste pickers keep depending on unofficial savings systems, which lack long-term security (World Bank, 2023).\n\nScaling Taka Bima to Dodoma seeks to close the gap between financial protection mechanisms and informal garbage workers. Important learning questions will probe adoption challenges, financial models, legal issues, and how technology could improve accessibility. The knowledge gained from this expansion will guide a national road map for including rubbish pickers into Tanzania's larger circular economy and social protection programs. By means of strategic alliances, creative business models, and community-driven participation, Taka Bima can establish a scalable and sustainable financial safety net for rubbish pickers spread around Tanzania."", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge  is scaling Taka Bima microinsurance to waste pickers in Dodoma from a standpoint of financial literacy, insurance trust, regulatory alignment, and affordability. Although the approach has shown success in Tanga, its adaptation to Dodoma's socioeconomic and waste management scene calls for customized involvement techniques, creative payment models, and closer linkages with local government and cooperatives. This difficulty aims to pinpoint the main enablers and obstacles for sustainable development so guaranteeing inclusion, accessibility, and long-term profitability.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Originally started in Tanga in response to the financial and social risks experienced by informal garbage workers, Taka Bima is the first microinsurance program for rubbish pickers in Tanzania. Designed under a collaboration between Taka ni Ajira Foundation, UNDP Accelerator Lab, and Jubilee Insurance, the project sought to give rubbish pickers financial protection, social security, and better working circumstances. Taka Bima has shown success in improving financial resilience among waste pickers since its founding by providing reasonably priced insurance coverage catered to their demand (UNDP, 2023).

Building on this success, the emphasis now is on expanding Taka Bima to Dodoma, the political capital of Tanzania, where the waste management ecology differs greatly from Tanga. Unlike Tanga, where well-organized garbage aggregation systems exist, Dodoma's waste industry stays mostly unorganized with scattered collecting and disposal methods. Financial fragility, limited insurance awareness, legal restrictions, and scalability issues all drive this difficulty (Taka ni Ajira Foundation, 2024). Dodoma's waste pickers are typically not financially literate and are reluctant to take insurance since they view it as unreliable or difficult. Furthermore, the lack of organized garbage cooperatives raises questions regarding the long-term viability of the project since it makes collective premium payments challenging.

Moreover, institutional and legal obstacles impede fit into current social protection systems. Although the Tanzanian government has underlined financial inclusion via policies such the National Financial Inclusion Framework (NFIF) 2018–2022, informal workers are mostly left out of official insurance schemes (Bank of Tanzania, 2022). Adapting Taka Bima to this new terrain will depend critically on the Dodoma Municipal Council, local rubbish collectors, and financial institutions as well as on other factors.

Dodoma's waste pickers work without any kind of financial protection right now, which causes unstable income, poor access to healthcare, and dangerous working circumstances. A sudden medical emergency or accident might cause great financial difficulty, therefore aggravating poverty and economic uncertainty. Since they remain outside municipal garbage policies and official labor systems, the lack of insurance further reduces their negotiating strength. Furthermore, mistrust of official financial services implies that many waste pickers keep depending on unofficial savings systems, which lack long-term security (World Bank, 2023).

Scaling Taka Bima to Dodoma seeks to close the gap between financial protection mechanisms and informal garbage workers. Important learning questions will probe adoption challenges, financial models, legal issues, and how technology could improve accessibility. The knowledge gained from this expansion will guide a national road map for including rubbish pickers into Tanzania's larger circular economy and social protection programs. By means of strategic alliances, creative business models, and community-driven participation, Taka Bima can establish a scalable and sustainable financial safety net for rubbish pickers spread around Tanzania.

Although they have great difficulty, informal  waste pickers are absolutely vital in managing urban waste in Tanzania. Only 1.8% of waste pickers have health insurance; 88% of waste pickers finance their healthcare out-of-pocket according to a 2023 survey spanning eight areas including Dodoma. Their lack of financial security makes them susceptible to financial difficulties resulting from health emergencies. Insurance coverage is still poor nationally; just 6.3% of the adult population had official insurance in 2009, but unofficial insurance use is almost 2%. Although Dodoma generates around 350 tons of solid garbage every day, only roughly 184 tons are collected through official services. Collecting valuable items such plastic bottles (86.2%), plastic containers (66.5%), and metals (55.8%), informal rubbish pickers help to close this gap. Even with their contributions, women frequently operate in dangerous environments without protective gear, which increases health risks and injuries. Acknowledging their critical importance in trash management, scaling microinsurance projects like Taka Bima in Dodoma is crucial to guarantee these workers financial stability and healthcare.



​Recent observations in Dodoma highlight the pressing challenges faced by waste pickers, underscoring the urgency of addressing their needs. A 2023 survey revealed that over 50% of waste pickers earn below the poverty line, with 35% making between TZS 3,000 to TZS 5,000 daily, equivalent to USD 1.11–USD 1.85. This economic hardship limits their access to essential services like health insurance. Additionally, Dodoma's rapid urbanization has led to inadequate waste management infrastructure, resulting in illegal dumping and environmental degradation. Despite their significant contributions to waste management, waste pickers often face stigmatization and lack formal recognition, exacerbating their vulnerability. These factors collectively emphasize the critical need for interventions that provide financial security and social support to waste pickers in Dodoma.

Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that digital agricultural solutions are not effectively diffused in local contexts, limiting their impact on smallholder farmers. We need to understand what digital solutions exist, what digital skills farmers require, and how e-commerce platforms can enhance market access. Many digital solutions are developed without sufficient localization, making them less effective in specific farming communities

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Digital innovation in agriculture holds the potential to improve productivity, sustainability, and resilience. However, many solutions remain underutilized by smallholder farmers due to gaps in digital literacy, access to technology, and contextual relevance. Large-scale producers often have better access to these solutions, creating disparities. Additionally, local e-commerce platforms remain underdeveloped, limiting market access for farmers. Addressing these gaps is crucial to ensuring inclusive agricultural transformation.

There are some interesting analysis completed by Metamorphosis: 

(ref: https://metamorphosis.org.mk/en/aktivnosti_arhiva/farmers-need-literacy-training-rural-coalition/; https://metamorphosis.org.mk/en/blog/rural-coalition-farmers-still-hang-on-the-counters-the-application-of-digitalization-in-its-initial-stage/) 

Digital Literacy and E-Service Usage: A national report revealed that while 76% of farmers possess an email address and over 92% have stable internet connections, only 19% have utilized e-services.

Additionally, 64% prefer in-person interactions at service counters over electronic communication.

Digital Skills Gap: Despite 85% of rural households owning smartphones and having internet access, only 29% of farmers are proficient in internet and electronic communications, indicating a significant

digital skills gap.

 E-Commerce Adoption: While 92% of respondents have payment cards, only 26% pay bills electronically, and a mere 11% engage in online shopping, highlighting the underutilization of e-commerce platforms. E- commerce platforms remain underutilized, particularly at country level there are no specialized e-commerce sales for small farmers. 

The dataset generated by our team showcases a variety of digital solutions in agriculture: Solutions Platform.

In addition, we have noticed that large-scale producers adopt digital solutions much faster then the small farmers.



Weak signals observed:

- Smallholder farmers report difficulty in navigating digital tools, even when solutions are available.

- Many digital solutions are developed without sufficient localization, making them less effective in specific farming communities.

- Interviews suggest that farmers are hesitant to adopt e-commerce due to trust issues, lack of digital payment access, and logistical concerns.

According to the analysis conducted by Metamorphosis these are these are some of the highlights: 

1. Trust and Familiarity Issues: Many farmers have email addresses but often forget passwords or leave accounts inactive, leading to reliance on in-person services. This indicates a lack of trust and familiarity with digital tools.

2. Preference for Traditional Methods: Despite having access to digital tools, a significant number of farmers prefer traditional methods of communication and service acquisition, suggesting resistance to digital adoption. 

3. Awareness and Accessibility: Over 52% of farmers are unaware of the national e-services portal (www.uslugi.gov.mk), and among those informed, only 18% have accessed it, often requiring assistance, indicating barriers in awareness and accessibility.

The high upfront costs required for infrastructure and technology make these investments accessible only to wealthy investors or governments capable of securing large loans. Projects such as hydroelectric dams, water treatment plants, recycling facilities, as well as environmentally friendly production of food and other goods or services highlight the challenge. \n\nFor example, constructing a hydroelectric dam can cost millions of dollars, and while it is profitable and in the long term, the immediate benefits are often concentrated in specific stakeholders, such as energy companies, while the social and environmental costs -like displacement or ecosystem disruption- fall on local communities. This asymmetry in benefits frequently results in resistance, as seen with several hydroelectric projects in Guatemala that were vandalized or opposed by communities who felt excluded from their benefits. \n\nSimilarly, smaller-scale circular economy efforts, like waste recycling facilities or sustainable agriculture projects, face financial hurdles. A small community recycling center, for example, can cost tens of thousands of dollars to establish, requiring land acquisition, machinery, and operational costs. Yet, the immediate financial returns are often slow, and the benefits -such as reduced environmental pollution- are spread across broader society rather than providing direct, tangible gains to individual contributors. This creates a collective action problem: individuals or small groups are unlikely to invest unless there are immediate returns and guarantees that others will also contribute. \n\nCompounding this challenge is the tendency for financing to support consumption rather than investment. For instance, remittances in Guatemala are often used to expand homes or purchase consumer goods rather than fund productive, sustainable projects like composting centers or irrigation systems. These consumption-driven choices limit the creation of shared assets that could yield long-term environmental and economic benefits. \n\nThe advent of blockchain technology introduces a transformative opportunity to overcome these barriers through tokenization. Tokenization allows large-scale investments to be divided into smaller, tradable digital tokens, enabling broader participation and ownership. Globally, we have seen initial applications of blockchain in renewable energy projects, such as tokenizing solar farms, where individuals can buy tokens representing a share of the energy produced. In Guatemala, early steps have been taken to tokenize real estate and solar panel production projects. For instance, local developers are experimenting with tokenized ownership of solar installations, allowing individuals to invest in a fraction of the panels and receive returns proportional to the energy generated. This model democratizes access, reduces reliance on single high-capital investors, and ensures that benefits are shared more equitably. \n\nAdding to these developments, artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to play a critical role in addressing the challenges of circular economy investments. AI-powered systems can enhance the efficiency and scalability of circular economy projects by optimizing operations and identifying opportunities for cost reduction. For example, AI algorithms can analyze energy usage in solar farms or irrigation systems, ensuring optimal performance and reducing waste. AI-driven predictive analytics can also help entrepreneurs and investors better understand market trends and assess the financial viability of projects, making investments less risky and more attractive.\n\nMoreover, AI technologies can bridge gaps in trust and transparency, which are key barriers to collaborative investments in Guatemala. Smart contracts integrated with AI can automatically verify compliance with agreements, distribute benefits equitably, and resolve disputes based on predefined rules, reducing reliance on Guatemala’s often weak justice system. Additionally, AI-driven platforms can improve accessibility by creating personalized user experiences and simplifying complex tokenization systems, making them easier for non-technical users to adopt.\n\nDespite these promising developments, challenges remain. Tokenization and AI technologies are not yet practical for widespread use. Legal frameworks and tax regulations for digital assets are unclear, and business models that ensure profitability and scalability for circular economy projects need to be refined. Moreover, community adoption depends on addressing the asymmetry of costs and benefits. For example, in an apartment building, installing solar panels requires upfront contributions from all residents, but the benefits, such as lower energy costs, may not be equally distributed unless mechanisms are in place to ensure fair participation and returns.\n\nA practical starting point for tokenized investments in Guatemala could be small-scale food production and waste management projects. Composting facilities or community irrigation systems, for instance, are manageable in scale and directly benefit the communities that participate in them. Tokenization could allow individuals to collectively fund these projects, ensuring shared ownership and returns. Paired with AI-driven optimization and management tools, these projects could maximize their efficiency and impact while fostering trust and equitable participation.\n\nBy integrating blockchain and AI technologies, Guatemala can unlock the potential of circular economy investments, creating a more inclusive, sustainable future while ensuring that the costs and benefits of these initiatives are shared more fairly across society. Together, these technologies provide powerful tools to address longstanding barriers, foster innovation, and drive the transition toward a regenerative economy. "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

At the center of the issue are the high upfront costs associated with circular economy projects, such as building composting facilities, water treatment plants, or recycling centers, as well as adopting energy-saving technologies like solar panels or irrigation systems. \n\nThese initiatives require significant capital, which is largely inaccessible to the majority of the population. The financial system favors large capital owners who can secure loans, while ordinary citizens face high interest rates and limited financing options. This disparity perpetuates a cycle in which only those with liquidity can invest in sustainability, leaving the broader population excluded from participating in or benefiting from these projects. \n\nAccess to financing for such investments is further complicated by Guatemala’s high levels of insecurity and uncertainty about the future. Without a robust social security system or widespread formal employment, most people prioritize short-term consumption over long-term savings or investment. For many, saving money is not an option, because there is no safety net to rely on in times of need. Instead, people channel their earnings into immediate experiences, such as dining out or purchasing consumer goods like clothing and electronics. Remittances, which constitute a major source of income for many families, are often used to buy vehicles, expand or renovate homes, or travel. While land purchases are culturally valued as a way to safeguard savings, this practice “parks” capital rather than circulating it productively within the economy, further limiting opportunities for collective investment in sustainable projects. \n\nAnother significant barrier is the pervasive lack of trust in Guatemala’s social and institutional structures. Interpersonal trust is low, making it difficult for individuals to embark on joint investments or collaborate on collective ventures. This is exacerbated by a weak justice system that struggles to enforce contracts or resolve disputes, creating additional risks for those considering cooperative efforts. While cooperatives provide some degree of trusted financial services, their scope is largely limited to saving and lending, and they do not facilitate more complex investment ventures, such as financing for circular economy projects. \n\nThe absence of clear and predictable business models for circular economy investments also deters participation. Projects like composting facilities, recycling plants, or agricultural waste management systems often lack reliable revenue streams or well-stablished frameworks for generating returns. Potential investors are hesitant to commit resources without a clear understanding of how these projects will become profitable. This uncertainty further compounds the challenges for those seeking to implement sustainable practices. \n\nAdding to these issues is the difficulty of adopting and implementing the necessary technologies. Circular economy projects often require integrating multiple systems, such as blockchain-based tools for tokenization or energy efficient technologies, which demand a level of technical expertise that is not widely available. The lack of prepackaged, user-friendly solutions means that individuals and organizations must navigate complex technological processes, which can be a significant barrier, particularly in rural or underserved areas with limited digital literacy. \n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) offers potential to address several of these challenges but also highlights additional gaps in adoption. AI systems can optimize operations for circular economy projects, such as managing energy consumption in solar installations or improving the efficiency of recycling processes. AI-driven predictive analytics can also identify market trends, help businesses assess project viability, and guide decision-making, reducing risks for potential investors. However, the integration of AI requires technical infrastructure, skilled professionals, and significant upfront investment—all of which are limited in Guatemala. Furthermore, the cultural and institutional gaps that hinder blockchain adoption, such as low trust and weak legal enforcement, also apply to AI, making its deployment challenging in collaborative or community-focused projects.\n\nThe broader cultural context also plays a role. In Guatemala, there is limited awareness of the long-term benefits of circular economy practices, and many people view sustainability as an additional cost rather than an opportunity. This mindset, coupled with the economic necessity of prioritizing immediate needs, makes it difficult to shift behavior toward more sustainable practices. Informal markets, which dominate much of the economy, further complicate efforts to scale up circular economy initiatives, as affordability and short-term gains often take precedence over efficiency or sustainability. \n\nFinally, Guatemala’s policy and regulatory environment does little to encourage circular economy investments. There are few incentives, such as tax breaks or subsidies, to support sustainable initiatives. Moreover, the legal framework for innovative financial instruments, like blockchain-based tokenization or AI-enhanced investment models, is underdeveloped, creating uncertainty for those looking to implement these solutions. Tokenization offers the potential to democratize access to circular economy investments by dividing large projects into smaller, tradable digital tokens that enable broader participation. AI can further enhance these models by improving decision-making, streamlining processes, and offering transparency. Early efforts in Guatemala, such as tokenizing solar panel production or real estate assets, demonstrate the potential of these technologies. However, the lack of clarity around legal contracts, taxes, and business models makes it difficult to scale these efforts effectively. \n\nAt its core, the challenge of adopting circular economy practices in Guatemala is a complex web of financial, cultural, and systemic barriers. High costs, limited access to financing, social distrust, technological gaps, and policy shortcomings all converge to create a landscape where sustainable investments remain out of reach for most people. Addressing these barriers will require coordinated efforts to provide better financing mechanisms, build trust, develop clear business models, and make technology—including blockchain and AI—more accessible. Without such changes, the promise of a circular economy will remain unrealized, and the long-term benefits of sustainability will continue to be overshadowed by short-term priorities. \n\n\nThe adoption of circular economy practices in Guatemala remains limited, despite their increasing necessity in the face of environmental degradation and pollution. The country’s reliance on nature-based products, such as agriculture and forestry, makes sustainable practices critical. However, pollution, deforestation, and poor waste management continue to degrade the natural resources on which these industries depend, threatening both environmental health and economic stability.  \n\nCircular economy practices, while essential, are difficult to adopt due to a combination of factors. A lack of knowledge about their benefits and implementation, high upfront costs, and low perceived immediate returns create significant barriers. Most small business as and individuals do not see the long-term advantages of sustainability if it means incurring additional expenses or shifting away from traditional methods. As a result, these practices are often deprioritized in favor of maintaining short-term affordability and efficiency. \n\nGuatemala’s high levels of informality in business and employment futher complicate efforts to integrate circular economy principles. Informal entrepreneurs, who constitute a significant portion of the economy, typically operate with limited resources and focus on minimizing costs to stay competitive. They are unlikely to invest in new technologies or practices unless these are low-cost, easy to adopt, and provide clear and immediate benefits. The weak state institutions and fragmented regulatory environment make top-down approaches, such as mandates or subsidies, challenging to enforce. Instead, successful adoption will depend on user-driven approaches that demonstrate tangible advantages for individuals and small businesses. \n\nOverall, the current state of circular economy adoption in Guatemala highlights the need for targeted efforts to address knowledge gaps, lower costs, and create incentives for user-driven adoption. The urgency of environmental degradation and the economic reliance on natural resources make this a critical moment to rethink how circular economy practices can be integrated into the country’s informal and resource-constrained economy. Without such efforts, Guatemala risks further environmental and economic instability, with diminishing opportunities to leverage sustainable practices for long-term resilience. \n\nThe failure to accelerate the adoption of circular economy practices in Guatemala has significant consequences. While Guatemala’s contribution to global climate change is negligible, the country faces increasing vulnerability to the effects of climate change, particularly the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Environmental degradation exacerbates this vulnerability, making it much harder for the country to adapt effectively. Without sustainable practices, the resilience of ecosystems and communities is further undermined, leaving Guatemala ill-equipped to cope with the impacts of climate change.   Environmental degradation has already begun to compromise access to natural resources that are vital for the economy, food production, and societal functioning. Deforestation, water pollution, soil contamination, and declining air quality are creating cascading challenges across multiple sectors. The availability of clean water is particularly critical and increasingly precarious. Watersheds and rivers are polluted at alarming rates, threatening both rural and urban communities’ access to clean water for drinking, agriculture, and industry. Similarly, the pollution and depletion of soil resources are undermining the country’s agricultural productivity, a strategic resource for Guatemala’s economy and food security.   The consequences of poor waste management are also mounting. Existing dump sites are nearing or have already reached capacity, collapsing under the strain of unchecked waste production. The lack of functional infrastructure for waste treatment and recycling is accelerating environmental damage and creating immediate health and safety risks for nearby communities. If these issues remain unaddressed, the capacity of Guatemala’s environment to sustain its population will continue to decline, jeopardizing long-term development.   Even if circular economy practices are adopted, the current financial and social systems risk excluding large segments of the population from participating in or benefiting from the transition. Under the existing framework, circular economy investments are primarily accessible to wealthy investors or larger organizations, leaving out small businesses and lower-income communities. These groups are often unable or unwilling to bear the upfront costs or the operational burdens associated with adopting sustainable practices. This inequitable distribution of costs and benefits creates significant social tensions, particularly when individuals and communities are expected to adapt without adequate support or access to the opportunities created by the transition.   This dynamic as the potential to fuel social conflict, as communities resist measures they perceive as unjust or overly burdensome. For instance, limitations on waste disposal or water use imposed without corresponding access to sustainable alternatives could spark widespread discontent. Similarly, if the economic benefits of circular economy practices are concentrated among a privileged few, public support for the transition will erode, further polarizing society and hindering progress.   In sum, delaying the adoption of circular economy practices exacerbates Guatemala’s vulnerability to climate change, depletes the natural resources that underpin its economy and society, and increases the likelihood of social conflict. Addressing these undesired effects requires not only accelerating the adoption of sustainable practices but also ensuring that the transition is equitable, inclusive, and supported by systems that enable all segments of society to participate and benefit. Without those measures, Guatemala risks deepening its environmental, economic, and social challenges, making adaptation to an increasingly volatile world even more difficult.\n\n"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": false, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""aea972c1-0eb8-4b0b-87cf-fb394c246bf8"", ""src"": null, ""html"": """", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""left"", ""has_content"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""6fca277f-9fb1-428a-b2f1-91cd42f51981"", ""src"": ""uploads/fe6065b0-bf6e-43b8-aa05-5ee642a59846/481599071d0ed54d71b1c7258eabfa6b.png"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""scale"": ""original"", ""required"": false, ""textalign"": ""center"", ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": """"}]], ""level"": ""media"", ""structure"": [{""id"": ""ac86f88e-6d60-432b-828f-b849c40a7b2d"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""is_excerpt"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""aea972c1-0eb8-4b0b-87cf-fb394c246bf8"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""embed"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}, {""id"": ""6fca277f-9fb1-428a-b2f1-91cd42f51981"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""img"", ""level"": ""media"", ""editable"": true, ""required"": false, ""instruction"": """"}], ""instruction"": ""Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency?

EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to lower the high entry barriers to Circular Economy investments and practices, enabling broader participation and accelerating their implementation.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In Guatemala, investing in circular economy initiatives presents both immense potential and significant barriers. The high upfront costs required for infrastructure and technology make these investments accessible only to wealthy investors or governments capable of securing large loans. Projects such as hydroelectric dams, water treatment plants, recycling facilities, as well as environmentally friendly production of food and other goods or services highlight the challenge. 

For example, constructing a hydroelectric dam can cost millions of dollars, and while it is profitable and in the long term, the immediate benefits are often concentrated in specific stakeholders, such as energy companies, while the social and environmental costs -like displacement or ecosystem disruption- fall on local communities. This asymmetry in benefits frequently results in resistance, as seen with several hydroelectric projects in Guatemala that were vandalized or opposed by communities who felt excluded from their benefits. 

Similarly, smaller-scale circular economy efforts, like waste recycling facilities or sustainable agriculture projects, face financial hurdles. A small community recycling center, for example, can cost tens of thousands of dollars to establish, requiring land acquisition, machinery, and operational costs. Yet, the immediate financial returns are often slow, and the benefits -such as reduced environmental pollution- are spread across broader society rather than providing direct, tangible gains to individual contributors. This creates a collective action problem: individuals or small groups are unlikely to invest unless there are immediate returns and guarantees that others will also contribute. 

Compounding this challenge is the tendency for financing to support consumption rather than investment. For instance, remittances in Guatemala are often used to expand homes or purchase consumer goods rather than fund productive, sustainable projects like composting centers or irrigation systems. These consumption-driven choices limit the creation of shared assets that could yield long-term environmental and economic benefits. 

The advent of blockchain technology introduces a transformative opportunity to overcome these barriers through tokenization. Tokenization allows large-scale investments to be divided into smaller, tradable digital tokens, enabling broader participation and ownership. Globally, we have seen initial applications of blockchain in renewable energy projects, such as tokenizing solar farms, where individuals can buy tokens representing a share of the energy produced. In Guatemala, early steps have been taken to tokenize real estate and solar panel production projects. For instance, local developers are experimenting with tokenized ownership of solar installations, allowing individuals to invest in a fraction of the panels and receive returns proportional to the energy generated. This model democratizes access, reduces reliance on single high-capital investors, and ensures that benefits are shared more equitably. 

Adding to these developments, artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to play a critical role in addressing the challenges of circular economy investments. AI-powered systems can enhance the efficiency and scalability of circular economy projects by optimizing operations and identifying opportunities for cost reduction. For example, AI algorithms can analyze energy usage in solar farms or irrigation systems, ensuring optimal performance and reducing waste. AI-driven predictive analytics can also help entrepreneurs and investors better understand market trends and assess the financial viability of projects, making investments less risky and more attractive.

Moreover, AI technologies can bridge gaps in trust and transparency, which are key barriers to collaborative investments in Guatemala. Smart contracts integrated with AI can automatically verify compliance with agreements, distribute benefits equitably, and resolve disputes based on predefined rules, reducing reliance on Guatemala’s often weak justice system. Additionally, AI-driven platforms can improve accessibility by creating personalized user experiences and simplifying complex tokenization systems, making them easier for non-technical users to adopt.

Despite these promising developments, challenges remain. Tokenization and AI technologies are not yet practical for widespread use. Legal frameworks and tax regulations for digital assets are unclear, and business models that ensure profitability and scalability for circular economy projects need to be refined. Moreover, community adoption depends on addressing the asymmetry of costs and benefits. For example, in an apartment building, installing solar panels requires upfront contributions from all residents, but the benefits, such as lower energy costs, may not be equally distributed unless mechanisms are in place to ensure fair participation and returns.

A practical starting point for tokenized investments in Guatemala could be small-scale food production and waste management projects. Composting facilities or community irrigation systems, for instance, are manageable in scale and directly benefit the communities that participate in them. Tokenization could allow individuals to collectively fund these projects, ensuring shared ownership and returns. Paired with AI-driven optimization and management tools, these projects could maximize their efficiency and impact while fostering trust and equitable participation.

By integrating blockchain and AI technologies, Guatemala can unlock the potential of circular economy investments, creating a more inclusive, sustainable future while ensuring that the costs and benefits of these initiatives are shared more fairly across society. Together, these technologies provide powerful tools to address longstanding barriers, foster innovation, and drive the transition toward a regenerative economy.

In Guatemala, adopting circular economy practices is filled with challenges rooted in financial, social, and systemic barrier. At the center of the issue are the high upfront costs associated with circular economy projects, such as building composting facilities, water treatment plants, or recycling centers, as well as adopting energy-saving technologies like solar panels or irrigation systems. 

These initiatives require significant capital, which is largely inaccessible to the majority of the population. The financial system favors large capital owners who can secure loans, while ordinary citizens face high interest rates and limited financing options. This disparity perpetuates a cycle in which only those with liquidity can invest in sustainability, leaving the broader population excluded from participating in or benefiting from these projects. 

Access to financing for such investments is further complicated by Guatemala’s high levels of insecurity and uncertainty about the future. Without a robust social security system or widespread formal employment, most people prioritize short-term consumption over long-term savings or investment. For many, saving money is not an option, because there is no safety net to rely on in times of need. Instead, people channel their earnings into immediate experiences, such as dining out or purchasing consumer goods like clothing and electronics. Remittances, which constitute a major source of income for many families, are often used to buy vehicles, expand or renovate homes, or travel. While land purchases are culturally valued as a way to safeguard savings, this practice “parks” capital rather than circulating it productively within the economy, further limiting opportunities for collective investment in sustainable projects. 

Another significant barrier is the pervasive lack of trust in Guatemala’s social and institutional structures. Interpersonal trust is low, making it difficult for individuals to embark on joint investments or collaborate on collective ventures. This is exacerbated by a weak justice system that struggles to enforce contracts or resolve disputes, creating additional risks for those considering cooperative efforts. While cooperatives provide some degree of trusted financial services, their scope is largely limited to saving and lending, and they do not facilitate more complex investment ventures, such as financing for circular economy projects. 

The absence of clear and predictable business models for circular economy investments also deters participation. Projects like composting facilities, recycling plants, or agricultural waste management systems often lack reliable revenue streams or well-stablished frameworks for generating returns. Potential investors are hesitant to commit resources without a clear understanding of how these projects will become profitable. This uncertainty further compounds the challenges for those seeking to implement sustainable practices. 

Adding to these issues is the difficulty of adopting and implementing the necessary technologies. Circular economy projects often require integrating multiple systems, such as blockchain-based tools for tokenization or energy efficient technologies, which demand a level of technical expertise that is not widely available. The lack of prepackaged, user-friendly solutions means that individuals and organizations must navigate complex technological processes, which can be a significant barrier, particularly in rural or underserved areas with limited digital literacy. 

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential to address several of these challenges but also highlights additional gaps in adoption. AI systems can optimize operations for circular economy projects, such as managing energy consumption in solar installations or improving the efficiency of recycling processes. AI-driven predictive analytics can also identify market trends, help businesses assess project viability, and guide decision-making, reducing risks for potential investors. However, the integration of AI requires technical infrastructure, skilled professionals, and significant upfront investment—all of which are limited in Guatemala. Furthermore, the cultural and institutional gaps that hinder blockchain adoption, such as low trust and weak legal enforcement, also apply to AI, making its deployment challenging in collaborative or community-focused projects.

The broader cultural context also plays a role. In Guatemala, there is limited awareness of the long-term benefits of circular economy practices, and many people view sustainability as an additional cost rather than an opportunity. This mindset, coupled with the economic necessity of prioritizing immediate needs, makes it difficult to shift behavior toward more sustainable practices. Informal markets, which dominate much of the economy, further complicate efforts to scale up circular economy initiatives, as affordability and short-term gains often take precedence over efficiency or sustainability. 

Finally, Guatemala’s policy and regulatory environment does little to encourage circular economy investments. There are few incentives, such as tax breaks or subsidies, to support sustainable initiatives. Moreover, the legal framework for innovative financial instruments, like blockchain-based tokenization or AI-enhanced investment models, is underdeveloped, creating uncertainty for those looking to implement these solutions. Tokenization offers the potential to democratize access to circular economy investments by dividing large projects into smaller, tradable digital tokens that enable broader participation. AI can further enhance these models by improving decision-making, streamlining processes, and offering transparency. Early efforts in Guatemala, such as tokenizing solar panel production or real estate assets, demonstrate the potential of these technologies. However, the lack of clarity around legal contracts, taxes, and business models makes it difficult to scale these efforts effectively. 

At its core, the challenge of adopting circular economy practices in Guatemala is a complex web of financial, cultural, and systemic barriers. High costs, limited access to financing, social distrust, technological gaps, and policy shortcomings all converge to create a landscape where sustainable investments remain out of reach for most people. Addressing these barriers will require coordinated efforts to provide better financing mechanisms, build trust, develop clear business models, and make technology—including blockchain and AI—more accessible. Without such changes, the promise of a circular economy will remain unrealized, and the long-term benefits of sustainability will continue to be overshadowed by short-term priorities. 


The adoption of circular economy practices in Guatemala remains limited, despite their increasing necessity in the face of environmental degradation and pollution. The country’s reliance on nature-based products, such as agriculture and forestry, makes sustainable practices critical. However, pollution, deforestation, and poor waste management continue to degrade the natural resources on which these industries depend, threatening both environmental health and economic stability.  

Circular economy practices, while essential, are difficult to adopt due to a combination of factors. A lack of knowledge about their benefits and implementation, high upfront costs, and low perceived immediate returns create significant barriers. Most small business as and individuals do not see the long-term advantages of sustainability if it means incurring additional expenses or shifting away from traditional methods. As a result, these practices are often deprioritized in favor of maintaining short-term affordability and efficiency. 

Guatemala’s high levels of informality in business and employment futher complicate efforts to integrate circular economy principles. Informal entrepreneurs, who constitute a significant portion of the economy, typically operate with limited resources and focus on minimizing costs to stay competitive. They are unlikely to invest in new technologies or practices unless these are low-cost, easy to adopt, and provide clear and immediate benefits. The weak state institutions and fragmented regulatory environment make top-down approaches, such as mandates or subsidies, challenging to enforce. Instead, successful adoption will depend on user-driven approaches that demonstrate tangible advantages for individuals and small businesses. 

Overall, the current state of circular economy adoption in Guatemala highlights the need for targeted efforts to address knowledge gaps, lower costs, and create incentives for user-driven adoption. The urgency of environmental degradation and the economic reliance on natural resources make this a critical moment to rethink how circular economy practices can be integrated into the country’s informal and resource-constrained economy. Without such efforts, Guatemala risks further environmental and economic instability, with diminishing opportunities to leverage sustainable practices for long-term resilience. 

The failure to accelerate the adoption of circular economy practices in Guatemala has significant consequences. While Guatemala’s contribution to global climate change is negligible, the country faces increasing vulnerability to the effects of climate change, particularly the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Environmental degradation exacerbates this vulnerability, making it much harder for the country to adapt effectively. Without sustainable practices, the resilience of ecosystems and communities is further undermined, leaving Guatemala ill-equipped to cope with the impacts of climate change.   Environmental degradation has already begun to compromise access to natural resources that are vital for the economy, food production, and societal functioning. Deforestation, water pollution, soil contamination, and declining air quality are creating cascading challenges across multiple sectors. The availability of clean water is particularly critical and increasingly precarious. Watersheds and rivers are polluted at alarming rates, threatening both rural and urban communities’ access to clean water for drinking, agriculture, and industry. Similarly, the pollution and depletion of soil resources are undermining the country’s agricultural productivity, a strategic resource for Guatemala’s economy and food security.   The consequences of poor waste management are also mounting. Existing dump sites are nearing or have already reached capacity, collapsing under the strain of unchecked waste production. The lack of functional infrastructure for waste treatment and recycling is accelerating environmental damage and creating immediate health and safety risks for nearby communities. If these issues remain unaddressed, the capacity of Guatemala’s environment to sustain its population will continue to decline, jeopardizing long-term development.   Even if circular economy practices are adopted, the current financial and social systems risk excluding large segments of the population from participating in or benefiting from the transition. Under the existing framework, circular economy investments are primarily accessible to wealthy investors or larger organizations, leaving out small businesses and lower-income communities. These groups are often unable or unwilling to bear the upfront costs or the operational burdens associated with adopting sustainable practices. This inequitable distribution of costs and benefits creates significant social tensions, particularly when individuals and communities are expected to adapt without adequate support or access to the opportunities created by the transition.   This dynamic as the potential to fuel social conflict, as communities resist measures they perceive as unjust or overly burdensome. For instance, limitations on waste disposal or water use imposed without corresponding access to sustainable alternatives could spark widespread discontent. Similarly, if the economic benefits of circular economy practices are concentrated among a privileged few, public support for the transition will erode, further polarizing society and hindering progress.   In sum, delaying the adoption of circular economy practices exacerbates Guatemala’s vulnerability to climate change, depletes the natural resources that underpin its economy and society, and increases the likelihood of social conflict. Addressing these undesired effects requires not only accelerating the adoption of sustainable practices but also ensuring that the transition is equitable, inclusive, and supported by systems that enable all segments of society to participate and benefit. Without those measures, Guatemala risks deepening its environmental, economic, and social challenges, making adaptation to an increasingly volatile world even more difficult.

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is to balance urban expansion with sustainable resource management while ensuring financial stability, efficiency,and strong governance. Through UNDP’s support for HDC in their strategic planning, we are providing actionable insights into development to create resilient, future-ready cities in the Maldives by 2030.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
The Housing Development Corporation (HDC) significantly influences the urban environment of the Maldives, aiming to transform quality living through sustainable urban development. HDC oversees the creation of Hulhumalé, the country's largest residential city, designed to house two-thirds of the population. In addition, HDC is developing an industrial island for waste management, a tourism commercial island, and extensive reclamation projects for new artificial

cities. The Maldives contends with issues like limited land availability and concentrated urban population. As HDC broadens its urban development efforts, it needs a strategic approach to resource management. The strategic plan for

2025-2030 focuses on improving financial stability, operational efficiency, governance, and long-term sustainability while

responding to socio-economic and environmental shifts. This strategic planning, driven by UNDP and HDC, is informed by the 2023 Hulhumalé Liveability Index study, using its pillars and scores as the framework for the strategic plan.

Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The Maldives Accelerator Lab has been leading this partnership with HDC for over two years, and the SAP initiative emerged as an extension of the existing co-financing agreement established with HDC, resulting in Acclab colleagues leading the engagement from CO. In 2023, this collaboration developed the country’s first City Liveability Index for Hulhumale, now featured on a dashboard on the HDC website. The current SAP work has mainly been directed and informed by the scores of the Liveability Index. Furthermore, the current landscape assessment of the SAP has focused on digital and innovative solutions, another key area of interest for the Maldives Acclab in 2025. There is significant potential to leverage smart cities and data-driven decision-making to enhance our co-financing partnership further and attract other donors.

While this progress is a positive milestone, it has led to a significant decline in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as international donors shift their focus to lower-income nations. As a result, UNDP Viet Nam and the Accelerator Lab must explore alternative funding models to sustain our work in driving innovation for sustainable development. \n\nThis challenge is further compounded by a global decline in international development funding, as donor priorities shift towards domestic concerns and emerging global crises. Development organizations worldwide are facing increased pressure to demonstrate financial sustainability and justify their value proposition beyond traditional models. \n\nAt the same time, Viet Nam is undergoing a major political restructuring under its new leadership. While this has created a temporary bureaucratic freeze, there are emerging policy opportunities, particularly with Resolutions 57 and 03, which signal a strong governmental push for science, technology, and innovation (STI). This shift presents a window for the Lab to position itself as a key partner in Viet Nam’s innovation landscape. \n\nHowever, a fundamental challenge remains: Viet Nam’s government has historically not paid for UN services. Unlike the private sector or donor-funded initiatives, government institutions are accustomed to receiving ODA rather than using their own budgets to procure services from international organizations. This lack of precedent presents both a mindset and structural barrier to positioning UNDP and the Accelerator Lab as a viable service provider in innovation consulting. \n\nAs a result, the current situation produces several undesired effects: \n\n- Uncertain financial sustainability of the Lab beyond 2025, risking a loss of innovation capacity within UNDP Viet Nam. \n\n- Limited agility in responding to local needs, as reliance on donor funding dictates priorities rather than market-driven demand. \n\n- Missed opportunities for client partnership with the Vietnamese government, as existing UNDP support is often viewed through the lens of donor-funded technical assistance rather than as a strategic service offering. \n\n- To overcome these challenges, the Lab must navigate a fundamental shift in how it operates—transforming from a donor-dependent initiative into a financially sustainable, market-responsive innovation service provider. "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

This report details how key donors—including Japan, USAID, and the EU—are adjusting their portfolios, leading to significant reductions in concessional aid. Such recalibration underscores the urgency for Vietnam to explore alternative funding mechanisms to sustain its development agenda. \n\nInnovation Policy and R&amp;D Investment: \nRecent policy moves, such as Vietnam’s Resolution 57-NQ/TW (2023) and Resolution 03/NQ-CP (2024), aim to boost the nation’s innovation ecosystem by enhancing digital transformation and public–private partnerships.

Our five years of on-the-ground experimentation, deep contextual knowledge, and global network of 90+ Labs uniquely position us to tackle this challenge. \n\n \n\n1. A Proven Track Record in Innovation &amp; Experimentation \n\nThe Lab has pioneered lean experimentation, solutions mapping, and systems thinking to address complex challenges in circular economy waste management, digital transformation, and public sector innovation. \n\nUnlike traditional UNDP country programs, which focus on policy advocacy and large-scale interventions, the Lab is agile, adaptive, and iterative—able to prototype, test, and refine innovation models before scaling. \n\n \n\n2. Bridging the Gap Between Government, Development, and Market-driven Innovation \n\nThe Vietnamese government recognizes the need for innovation but lacks the internal capacity to design and execute human-centered, experimental approaches. \n\nPrivate sector consultancies provide innovation services but are often detached from local development needs and lack a sustainability lens. \n\nThe Accelerator Lab operates at the intersection of these two spaces—leveraging UNDP’s policy credibility while offering the agility and problem-solving mindset of a start-up. \n\n3. Global Knowledge + Local Application \n\nThrough the UNDP Accelerator Labs network, we have access to cutting-edge methodologies, global case studies, and peer-to-peer learning opportunities, ensuring that Viet Nam benefits from global best practices. \n\nOur deep contextual expertise in Viet Nam’s unique governance, economic, and cultural landscape allows us to localize and tailor innovation services in ways that international consulting firms cannot. \n\n4. A Unique and Sustainable Business Model \n\nUnlike traditional UNDP programs, which rely on ODA and donor grants, the Lab’s new fee-for-service model will create financial sustainability, reducing reliance on external funding. \n\nThis approach aligns with the Vietnamese government’s push for public-private partnerships in innovation, creating an opportunity to mainstream innovation services as a strategic investment rather than a donor-funded activity. "", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge?

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that the UNDP Viet Nam AccLab and CO need to fundraise and establish a cost-recovery mechanism for our activities to ensure Lab sustainability and continued viability

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Over the past decades, Viet Nam has experienced rapid economic growth, transitioning from a low-income to a low-middle-income country. While this progress is a positive milestone, it has led to a significant decline in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as international donors shift their focus to lower-income nations. As a result, UNDP Viet Nam and the Accelerator Lab must explore alternative funding models to sustain our work in driving innovation for sustainable development. 

This challenge is further compounded by a global decline in international development funding, as donor priorities shift towards domestic concerns and emerging global crises. Development organizations worldwide are facing increased pressure to demonstrate financial sustainability and justify their value proposition beyond traditional models. 

At the same time, Viet Nam is undergoing a major political restructuring under its new leadership. While this has created a temporary bureaucratic freeze, there are emerging policy opportunities, particularly with Resolutions 57 and 03, which signal a strong governmental push for science, technology, and innovation (STI). This shift presents a window for the Lab to position itself as a key partner in Viet Nam’s innovation landscape. 

However, a fundamental challenge remains: Viet Nam’s government has historically not paid for UN services. Unlike the private sector or donor-funded initiatives, government institutions are accustomed to receiving ODA rather than using their own budgets to procure services from international organizations. This lack of precedent presents both a mindset and structural barrier to positioning UNDP and the Accelerator Lab as a viable service provider in innovation consulting. 

As a result, the current situation produces several undesired effects: 

- Uncertain financial sustainability of the Lab beyond 2025, risking a loss of innovation capacity within UNDP Viet Nam. 

- Limited agility in responding to local needs, as reliance on donor funding dictates priorities rather than market-driven demand. 

- Missed opportunities for client partnership with the Vietnamese government, as existing UNDP support is often viewed through the lens of donor-funded technical assistance rather than as a strategic service offering. 

- To overcome these challenges, the Lab must navigate a fundamental shift in how it operates—transforming from a donor-dependent initiative into a financially sustainable, market-responsive innovation service provider.

Declining ODA and Shifting Donor Priorities: 
Between 2000 and 2020, Vietnam was a major recipient of Official Development Assistance (ODA), receiving between $1 – $4 billion annually.  According to the DevelopmentAid Country Report on Vietnam (2018), Vietnam’s net Official Development Assistance as a percentage of GDP has steadily declined as the country’s robust economic growth has gradually reduced its aid dependency due to Vietnam's improved human development indicators and its entry into middle-income country status.  .   

Financing Challenges and IDA Graduation: 
The Oxfam Library report on Financing Development in Vietnam offers an in-depth analysis of Vietnam’s shift away from concessional financing as it nears IDA graduation. This report details how key donors—including Japan, USAID, and the EU—are adjusting their portfolios, leading to significant reductions in concessional aid. Such recalibration underscores the urgency for Vietnam to explore alternative funding mechanisms to sustain its development agenda. 

Innovation Policy and R&amp;D Investment: 
Recent policy moves, such as Vietnam’s Resolution 57-NQ/TW (2023) and Resolution 03/NQ-CP (2024), aim to boost the nation’s innovation ecosystem by enhancing digital transformation and public–private partnerships. Meanwhile, World Bank data indicate that current R&amp;D investment is around 0.5% of GDP, with a target of 2% by 2030—an ambitious goal to drive sustainable economic transformation.



Our existing relationship with government partner such as the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), the National Innovation Center (NIC), and provincial such as Danang and Hue hint at a growing interest in leveraging UNDP expertise for innovation consulting. This is something we have done for free in previous years, but it can be potential entry point for UNDP’s services. 

New leadership in Vietnam and a strong push in innovation and technology such as with Resolution 57 and 03 in 2024-2025 to push investment in R&amp;D indicate a room of opportunity



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The UNDP Accelerator Lab Viet Nam brings a unique, systems-focused approach to innovation that sets it apart from traditional development actors, private sector consultancies, and government agencies. Our five years of on-the-ground experimentation, deep contextual knowledge, and global network of 90+ Labs uniquely position us to tackle this challenge. 

 

1. A Proven Track Record in Innovation &amp; Experimentation 

The Lab has pioneered lean experimentation, solutions mapping, and systems thinking to address complex challenges in circular economy waste management, digital transformation, and public sector innovation. 

Unlike traditional UNDP country programs, which focus on policy advocacy and large-scale interventions, the Lab is agile, adaptive, and iterative—able to prototype, test, and refine innovation models before scaling. 

 

2. Bridging the Gap Between Government, Development, and Market-driven Innovation 

The Vietnamese government recognizes the need for innovation but lacks the internal capacity to design and execute human-centered, experimental approaches. 

Private sector consultancies provide innovation services but are often detached from local development needs and lack a sustainability lens. 

The Accelerator Lab operates at the intersection of these two spaces—leveraging UNDP’s policy credibility while offering the agility and problem-solving mindset of a start-up. 

3. Global Knowledge + Local Application 

Through the UNDP Accelerator Labs network, we have access to cutting-edge methodologies, global case studies, and peer-to-peer learning opportunities, ensuring that Viet Nam benefits from global best practices. 

Our deep contextual expertise in Viet Nam’s unique governance, economic, and cultural landscape allows us to localize and tailor innovation services in ways that international consulting firms cannot. 

4. A Unique and Sustainable Business Model 

Unlike traditional UNDP programs, which rely on ODA and donor grants, the Lab’s new fee-for-service model will create financial sustainability, reducing reliance on external funding. 

This approach aligns with the Vietnamese government’s push for public-private partnerships in innovation, creating an opportunity to mainstream innovation services as a strategic investment rather than a donor-funded activity.

Existing Data Gaps &amp; How Our Innovation Methods Address Them

To design a market-fit innovation service, we need to fill critical information gaps about demand, feasibility, pricing, and operational models for monetizing UNDP innovation services in Viet Nam. Below are key data gaps and how our selected innovation methods will address them:

 Market Demand &amp; Willingness to Pay for Innovation Services

  Data Gap:

What specific innovation services are in demand by government agencies, businesses, and donors in Viet Nam?
Are these stakeholders willing to pay, and if so, how much?

 How We Address It:

Human-Centered Design &amp; Behavioral Insights → Conduct deep listening &amp; user research to understand government and business needs.
Lean Experimentation → Pilot small-scale paid services to test demand and validate pricing.
Business Model Innovation → Use competitive benchmarking to identify how similar innovation services are monetized elsewhere.

 Value Added:
Provides real-world insights into which services have market potential and at what price points, ensuring we don’t create services that no one will buy.

Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that despite being a country with tremendous tourism potential, Bangladesh is not being able to take the full advantage of it. In 2023, over 30 million domestic and 655,000 foreign tourists vacationed in Bangladesh, marking the country's immense potential to become a ‘Tourism Hotspot’ of Southeast Asia.[1] Despite this, there is no integrated tourist database, resulting in a holistic data sharing framework. Such lack in a National Data Framework in tourism sector hinders data-driven decision making for policymakers to implement Bangladesh Tourism Master Plan.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Bangladesh, with its rich cultural heritage, stunning landscapes, Cox’s Bazar—the world’s longest sea beach—and the Sundarbans, holds immense tourism potential. However, poor stakeholder coordination and data gaps hinder progress in this sector. The Travel &amp; Tourism Development Index 2024 ranks Bangladesh the lowest in South Asia for policies enabling sustainable tourism development, underscoring urgent reform needs. To establish Bangladesh as a sustainable and inclusive global tourism hub, the Bangladesh Tourism Board (BTB) developed a 25-year Master Plan. Data gaps in areas like sustainable tourism, traditional local products sources and visitor expectations led to a strategic collaboration between BTB and UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab for informed policy development and implementation.

In Bangladesh, tourism sector contributes slightly greater than 3% in the national GDP, whereas Maldives one-third of the national GDP is contributed by the tourism sector. Approximately, 5 million people are directly or indirectly engaged in the tourism sector of Bangladesh and additional 2 million workforce will be added in this sector gradually within 2030. Despite immense potential and natural resources, Bangladesh is unable to reap the full benefits of tourism due to lack of centralized data framework and a holistic tourism plan.

Bangladesh is endowed with remarkable natural beauty, yet the country has struggled to harness its tourism sector as a major contributor to GDP. Unregulated and unplanned growth has led to the absence of a centralized tourism information hub and ineffective policy implementation. The lack of data innovation and real-time analytics has hindered understanding of tourist preferences, sustainable practices, and personalization. With the rising popularity of adventure and Community-Based Tourism (CBT), there is an urgent need for data-driven solutions and AI-powered innovations to elevate the sector and ensure its sustainable growth.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab has conducted experiments on CBT, data innovation, system thinking and AI intervention. The Accelerator Lab has strong collaboration with Bangladesh Tourism Board (BTB) and both parties jointly conducted relevant interventions in multiple locations of the country. The lab also contributed to formulating in Bangladesh Tourism Master Plan which outlines a 25-year strategy to position the country as a premier global tourist destination by 2041. UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab is uniquely positioned to contribute to developing a National Data Framework to implement Bangladesh Tourism Master Plan in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. From its multilateral partnership, the Accelerator Lab is also positioned to bring in Government agencies, private sector stakeholders, industry association for their participation and organizational buy-in. The Lab will also connect relevant Global Accelerator Labs for knowledge and experience sharing. Previously, UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab collaborated with UNDP Thailand acceleration Lab on sharing learning and experience on community-based tourism. These global knowledge sharing adds tremendous value in such initiatives. Lab will also leverage Artificial Intelligence in implementation of the Tourism Master Plan.

Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy
Challenge statement
null
Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that AI presents many potential pitfalls and concerns in the Caribbean arts and heritage sector if not understand and applied responsibly. Conversely, if better understood and used with care, AI can present many opportunities for growth in the Orange Economy.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
AI has significantly upended the creative sector in recent years, with many artists concerned that it is compromising vital elements of creativity, included through job loss and loss of intellectual property rights amongst other issue areas. This is driven by the rapid rise of AI and resulting misuse and misunderstanding around it. This involves actors such as artists, archivists, curators, copyright lawyers, archaeologists, film/tv producers, actors and more. Currently, many persons involved in the Orange Economy in the Caribbean are apprehensive about AI's impact on the sector, with the resulting undesired effect of persons not embracing AI for good.

Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
Our Accelerator Lab will leverage its convening power and ability to craft innovation journeys by hosting a Symposium on AI in Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage. This Symposium will bring together expert panelists before local community members for discuss on subjects such as human rights and access of A.I. in Caribbean arts and heritage, gender &amp; LGBTQIA+ in heritage interpretation through digital technologies, the implications of AI in film and TV, digital technologies and intangible cultural heritage, copyright law in the age of AI nad more. Our Lab needs to work on this challenge based on its unique focus on R&amp;D for sustainable develop and, as AI is an emerging focus in the creative sphere, there is a gap we can fill in terms of generating understanding of the responsible use of AI in the creative sector, which is not widely understood. It is worth investing resources to this challenge as the creative economy represents immense potential as a source of economic growth and diversification in the Caribbean.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
The Acc Lab for BBD &amp; EC will be posting a Symposium on AI in Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage, discussing its many opportunities and challenges in the creative sector.

Valorization of green waste in Metbasta
Challenge statement
null
Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.

BIG BET

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the valorization of green waste will contribute to reducing inequalities and promoting inclusion

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In 2024, The Acceleretor Lab has started a major initiative in Kairouan, in the community of Metbasta. After installing 30 bins for organic waste and 5 for sorting plastic, several awareness-raising actions have been organized, particularly with women and on social networks by inviting page holders to participate in this awareness-raising effort. Currently, the majority of waste is no longer thrown into the open but collected and we note that a new collective consciousness has been established among the inhabitants.
The next step will be the valorization of green waste and the formalization of marginalized artisans

Survey

A quantitative and qualitative survey was conducted among artisans.



Sociologic study among asrtisans



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab is working in a rural area that is cut off from many public services, including municipal ones. We fully immersed ourselves with the villagers, gaining the trust of community leaders. This trust capital allows us to carry out experiments, particularly on waste management, which is the village's main problem. We are in the process of developing a major partnership (public sector, private sector, civil society) around this initiative.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Through behavior change and waste management, the Accelerator Lab is building a bridge of trust between citizens and the administration, fostering inclusion, job creation, and access to services.

Challenge statement
null
Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
BIG BET

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that the agricultural workforce in Syria lacks the necessary technical, business, and climate-resilient skills needed to compete in an evolving labor market. The prolonged crisis has hindered skill development, and as Syria transitions towards economic recovery, the agricultural sector risks falling behind due to an unprepared workforce.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
The Syrian crisis has significantly disrupted the labor market, especially in agriculture, which is a cornerstone of the economy and food security. Over 15 years of instability have led to outdated farming practices, a lack of innovation, and an educational system misaligned with labor market demands. With anticipated foreign investments and policy reforms, the sector presents opportunities for growth, but these cannot be leveraged effectively unless the skills gap is addressed. The lack of modern agricultural skills affects farmers, students, recent graduates, and policymakers, creating inefficiencies and limiting economic opportunities.

Undesired effects include:

Low productivity and sustainability in farming practices.
Limited employment opportunities for youth and returning professionals.
Increased vulnerability to climate change effects, such as droughts.
Weak linkages between academic institutions and labor market needs.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, over 60% of agricultural workers lack formal training in modern farming techniques.
Unemployment among agricultural graduates exceeds 35%, indicating a mismatch between education and market needs.
Climate-induced droughts have reduced Syria’s agricultural productivity by 40%, emphasizing the need for climate-adaptive skills.
Less than 20% of farmers have access to advanced agronomic knowledge or technology.



Farmers and young professionals report difficulty in accessing training on sustainable agriculture, climate-smart techniques, and agribusiness.
Private sector investments in agriculture are increasing, yet they highlight the scarcity of skilled labor as a major barrier.
University students express frustration over outdated curricula that do not prepare them for the evolving job market.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The UNDP Accelerator Lab is uniquely positioned to address this challenge because:

It brings innovation and experimentation to skill development, testing new methods such as blended learning and peer-to-peer training.
It has the networks and partnerships to convene key actors like the Ministry of Agriculture, universities, and private sector stakeholders.
It focuses on systemic change, ensuring alignment between skills development, policy reforms, and market needs.
It leverages data-driven approaches, using skill profiling tools to create targeted interventions.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
📢 Syria’s agriculture sector is at risk due to a major skills gap! 🌱🚜 UNDP Accelerator Lab is tackling this by piloting a Skill Gap Analysis, bridging education &amp; labor market needs for a resilient agricultural workforce. #SkillsForTheFuture #AgriInnovation

This deficiency is driven by a lack of integration and coordination among various data sources and methodologies currently in use. The systems in place are not equipped to harness modern technological capabilities such as AI-driven analytics and comprehensive data aggregation, which are essential for timely and predictive insights into social dynamics and potential conflicts.\n\n\n\nInvolved Parties:\n\nThe parties involved include UNDP’s Strategic Policy Unit, field staff, local authorities, community members, international partners, and donors. Each group plays a specific role in gathering, analyzing, and responding to data, but the effectiveness of their efforts is hindered by the disjointed nature of existing systems.\n\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nCurrently, the systems for monitoring social tensions are fragmented and lack the capability to provide a unified, real-time view of emerging risks. Similarly, needs assessments are often siloed and do not fully integrate the insights and input from local communities, especially marginalized and vulnerable groups. This results in interventions that may not be fully aligned with the actual needs on the ground.\n\n\n\nUndesired Effects:\n\nThe primary undesired effect of these challenges is the increased likelihood of escalating tensions due to missed opportunities for early intervention. When emerging risks are not promptly or accurately identified, preventive actions cannot be taken, potentially leading to conflicts that could have been mitigated or avoided. Additionally, the lack of effective participatory needs assessments means that recovery and development efforts may not effectively address the most pressing community needs, leading to less efficient use of resources and reduced impact of interventions.\n\n"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)

“Our challenge is that current systems lack the capacity for real-time monitoring of social tensions, comprehensive needs assessments, and centralized knowledge management. This limitation hampers our ability to proactively respond to emerging threats and effectively plan interventions in Syria’s fragile socio-economic environment.”

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

History and Drivers:

The challenge originates from the limitations of existing systems that are unable to provide real-time and accurate monitoring of social tensions in Syria. This deficiency is driven by a lack of integration and coordination among various data sources and methodologies currently in use. The systems in place are not equipped to harness modern technological capabilities such as AI-driven analytics and comprehensive data aggregation, which are essential for timely and predictive insights into social dynamics and potential conflicts.



Involved Parties:

The parties involved include UNDP’s Strategic Policy Unit, field staff, local authorities, community members, international partners, and donors. Each group plays a specific role in gathering, analyzing, and responding to data, but the effectiveness of their efforts is hindered by the disjointed nature of existing systems.



Current Situation:

Currently, the systems for monitoring social tensions are fragmented and lack the capability to provide a unified, real-time view of emerging risks. Similarly, needs assessments are often siloed and do not fully integrate the insights and input from local communities, especially marginalized and vulnerable groups. This results in interventions that may not be fully aligned with the actual needs on the ground.



Undesired Effects:

The primary undesired effect of these challenges is the increased likelihood of escalating tensions due to missed opportunities for early intervention. When emerging risks are not promptly or accurately identified, preventive actions cannot be taken, potentially leading to conflicts that could have been mitigated or avoided. Additionally, the lack of effective participatory needs assessments means that recovery and development efforts may not effectively address the most pressing community needs, leading to less efficient use of resources and reduced impact of interventions.

1. Social Tension Indicators:

 • Data types include social media trends, local reports, satellite imagery, and field data.

 • The use of predictive analytics will help identify potential conflict hotspots, enabling proactive interventions.

 2. Participatory Needs Assessments:

 • Engaging local authorities, civil society organizations, and community members to identify urgent needs.

 • Multilingual interfaces and data collection tools will ensure that assessments are inclusive and reflect the priorities of all community segments, especially marginalized and vulnerable groups.



1. Emergence of New Social Tensions: Field staff and local partners have reported emerging social tensions due to economic instability and political uncertainties. These tensions, if unchecked, could escalate into larger conflicts, emphasizing the need for a robust and proactive early warning system.

 2. Feedback from Community Engagements: During community engagement sessions, participants have expressed a need for more timely and responsive interventions that reflect their immediate and evolving needs. This feedback underscores the importance of having an efficient participatory needs assessment process that truly captures and addresses community concerns.

 3. Reports from Field Assessments: Field assessments have often highlighted the disconnect between the data collected and the actual interventions implemented. This gap points to the necessity for a more integrated and responsive system that ensures data collected from the ground directly informs strategic decisions and actions.

 4. Discussions with International Partners: Conversations with international donors and partners have revealed a growing expectation for more data-driven and evidence-based reporting on project outcomes and needs assessments. This demand highlights the urgency for systems like Horizon 360 that can provide comprehensive and credible data analysis to support funding and strategic decisions.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

1. Innovative Approach: The Accelerator Lab brings a cutting-edge, data-driven methodology to tackle complex issues. By deploying Horizon 360, the Lab integrates AI and machine learning technologies to analyze and interpret vast amounts of data from diverse sources.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\n\n\nHistory and Drivers:\n\n • Conflict Onset: Digital hate speech in Syria gained momentum with the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, which began as part of the Arab Spring. This period marked a shift from peaceful protests to a violent civil war exacerbated by ethnic, religious, and political divisions.\n\n • Use of Digital Platforms: Various factions, including the Syrian government, opposition groups, extremist entities, and external influencers, have utilized social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to disseminate hate speech. These platforms became digital battlegrounds where competing narratives and inflammatory rhetoric targeted specific groups based on religion, ethnicity, political beliefs, gender, and geographic origin.\n\n\n\nContributing Factors:\n\n • Sectarian and Ethnic Divides: The conflict heightened existing sectarian and ethnic tensions, which were then amplified online. Digital platforms have been used to spread false narratives and incite violence, particularly targeting Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Kurdish, and Turkmen communities.\n\n • Political Manipulation: Digital spaces have also been exploited to attack political opposition, label dissenters as traitors or foreign agents, and manipulate public opinion.\n\n • Technological Proliferation: The widespread access to internet and social media in Syria, despite infrastructure challenges, has facilitated the rapid spread of hate speech.\n\n\n\nStakeholders Involved:\n\n • State Actors and Opposition: Both the Syrian government and various opposition factions have been involved in propagating digital hate speech.\n\n • Extremist Groups: Entities like ISIS have used digital platforms for recruitment and spreading their extremist ideologies.\n\n • International Actors: External countries and organizations have sometimes contributed to the spread of digital hate through support of various factions within Syria.\n\n • Tech Companies: Platforms that host user-generated content have been key venues for the dissemination of hate speech but also have a role in its moderation.\n\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\n • Digital hate speech continues to be pervasive across Syria, with new narratives emerging in the post-Assad transitional phase. This speech remains a potent tool for social manipulation, contributing to ongoing instability and hindering peacebuilding efforts.\n\n\n\nUndesired Effects:\n\n • Social Fragmentation: Hate speech has deepened the divisions within Syrian society, making reconciliation more challenging.\n\n • Violence and Displacement: Incitements to violence through digital hate speech have led to physical violence and displacement of communities.\n\n • Hindered Recovery and Governance: The pervasive nature of hate speech undermines efforts at governance and stabilization, as it continues to polarize the populace and disrupt efforts at building inclusive political and social systems.\n\n"", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Background: What is the history of your challenge?

Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.

EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)

“Our challenge is that digital hate speech in Syria has deeply permeated social media and online platforms, exacerbating sectarian, ethnic, political, gender-based, and area-based divisions. This widespread digital hate speech poses significant barriers to social cohesion, reconciliation, and peacebuilding efforts in the post-Regime era, making it a critical obstacle to the country’s recovery and the establishment of a stable, inclusive society.”

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The background of the challenge of digital hate speech in Syria is deeply rooted in the country’s recent history and the dynamics of its prolonged conflict. Here’s a detailed breakdown:



History and Drivers:

 • Conflict Onset: Digital hate speech in Syria gained momentum with the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, which began as part of the Arab Spring. This period marked a shift from peaceful protests to a violent civil war exacerbated by ethnic, religious, and political divisions.

 • Use of Digital Platforms: Various factions, including the Syrian government, opposition groups, extremist entities, and external influencers, have utilized social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to disseminate hate speech. These platforms became digital battlegrounds where competing narratives and inflammatory rhetoric targeted specific groups based on religion, ethnicity, political beliefs, gender, and geographic origin.



Contributing Factors:

 • Sectarian and Ethnic Divides: The conflict heightened existing sectarian and ethnic tensions, which were then amplified online. Digital platforms have been used to spread false narratives and incite violence, particularly targeting Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Kurdish, and Turkmen communities.

 • Political Manipulation: Digital spaces have also been exploited to attack political opposition, label dissenters as traitors or foreign agents, and manipulate public opinion.

 • Technological Proliferation: The widespread access to internet and social media in Syria, despite infrastructure challenges, has facilitated the rapid spread of hate speech.



Stakeholders Involved:

 • State Actors and Opposition: Both the Syrian government and various opposition factions have been involved in propagating digital hate speech.

 • Extremist Groups: Entities like ISIS have used digital platforms for recruitment and spreading their extremist ideologies.

 • International Actors: External countries and organizations have sometimes contributed to the spread of digital hate through support of various factions within Syria.

 • Tech Companies: Platforms that host user-generated content have been key venues for the dissemination of hate speech but also have a role in its moderation.



Current Situation:

 • Digital hate speech continues to be pervasive across Syria, with new narratives emerging in the post-Assad transitional phase. This speech remains a potent tool for social manipulation, contributing to ongoing instability and hindering peacebuilding efforts.



Undesired Effects:

 • Social Fragmentation: Hate speech has deepened the divisions within Syrian society, making reconciliation more challenging.

 • Violence and Displacement: Incitements to violence through digital hate speech have led to physical violence and displacement of communities.

 • Hindered Recovery and Governance: The pervasive nature of hate speech undermines efforts at governance and stabilization, as it continues to polarize the populace and disrupt efforts at building inclusive political and social systems.

1. Social Media Analysis:

 • Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram were analyzed using keyword analysis, hashtag tracking, and content monitoring tools. This data provided insights into the volume, types, and impact of hate speech across different regions and social groups in Syria.

 2. Official Reports:

 • United Nations (OHCHR, UNESCO): Reports on human rights violations and hate speech provide verified insights into the severity and consequences of hate speech.

 • Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International: These organizations offer documented cases and analyses of hate speech and its impacts on societal divisions and violence.

 • Local Civil Society Groups: Reports from within Syria offer ground-level data on how digital hate speech affects different communities.

 3. News and Media Archives:

 • Analysis of local and international news outlets helped identify specific incidents of hate speech and its real-world implications, supporting the data with narrative examples that were publicly reported.

 4. Case Studies and Examples:

 • Documented instances of hate speech, as reported by various media and human rights organizations, provide concrete examples that illustrate the pervasive nature of the problem and its damaging effects.

 5. Quantitative Data from Web Scraping Platforms:

 • Tools like BeautifulSoup were used to scrape data from major social media platforms, providing quantitative measures of hate speech frequency, geographical spread, and the intensity of the narratives used.



Shifts in Narrative Post-Conflict: Observations of the digital landscape show a shift in hate speech narratives following the hypothetical fall of the Assad regime. This includes a transition from targeting opposition figures to vilifying former regime loyalists, indicating a volatile and shifting digital environment that can rapidly adapt to political changes, perpetuating cycles of hate and mistrust.



Emerging Trends in Digital Platforms: Weak signals include the adaptation of hate speech tactics, such as the use of memes, localized slang, and coded language on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, making it more challenging to moderate and detect. The sophistication of these methods shows an evolving challenge that requires equally sophisticated responses.



Community Responses and Resilience: Qualitative data from community feedback, as observed in digital forums and local responses, indicates varying degrees of resilience to hate speech.

Plans are currently being developed to further expand geothermal and solar capacity, as well as evaluate the inclusion of other energy sources. However, the country faces challenges in managing high energy costs due to its hybrid model, which involves the participation of both the public and private sectors in the entire energy system.\n\n\nOne of the critical problems is the high cost of private sector participation in energy distribution. Although energy coverage in rural areas has reached 96.6% (EHPM, 2023), closing the remaining gap is costly. Furthermore, energy demand in rural areas is expected to increase, driven by agricultural productivity and socioeconomic activities such as tourism.\n\nNext year, the country will propose a comprehensive review of the legal and policy framework of the energy sector, which represents an opportunity to include social needs and less developed sectors without slowing economic and sustainable growth.\n\nThe agricultural sector, a key contributor to GDP at 4.6% in 2023 and an essential pillar of food security and poverty reduction, faces unique challenges. It relies heavily on non-renewable energy sources, operates with insufficient infrastructure and has low adoption of advanced technologies. These factors increase production costs, limit operational efficiency and endanger food security and the economic sustainability of the sector.\n\nThe country's vulnerability to climate change exacerbates these problems, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions to strengthen resilience in agri-food production. Addressing these challenges requires a gender-sensitive approach and disaggregated data to develop more effective and inclusive measures.\n\nOne of the biggest gaps in the agri-food sector is the lack of accurate and up-to-date data on energy consumption, which makes it difficult to make informed decisions and implement effective energy efficiency policies. In addition, technological, economic and regulatory barriers hinder the integration of renewable energies and digital technologies—such as the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)—that have the potential to transform the sector into a more sustainable and competitive model."", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": true, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""Challenge statement: What is your challenge?

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
El Salvador has made significant progress in its energy matrix, with 61% of its installed capacity coming from renewable sources. Plans are currently being developed to further expand geothermal and solar capacity, as well as evaluate the inclusion of other energy sources. However, the country faces challenges in managing high energy costs due to its hybrid model, which involves the participation of both the public and private sectors in the entire energy system.


One of the critical problems is the high cost of private sector participation in energy distribution. Although energy coverage in rural areas has reached 96.6% (EHPM, 2023), closing the remaining gap is costly. Furthermore, energy demand in rural areas is expected to increase, driven by agricultural productivity and socioeconomic activities such as tourism.

Next year, the country will propose a comprehensive review of the legal and policy framework of the energy sector, which represents an opportunity to include social needs and less developed sectors without slowing economic and sustainable growth.

The agricultural sector, a key contributor to GDP at 4.6% in 2023 and an essential pillar of food security and poverty reduction, faces unique challenges. It relies heavily on non-renewable energy sources, operates with insufficient infrastructure and has low adoption of advanced technologies. These factors increase production costs, limit operational efficiency and endanger food security and the economic sustainability of the sector.

The country's vulnerability to climate change exacerbates these problems, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions to strengthen resilience in agri-food production. Addressing these challenges requires a gender-sensitive approach and disaggregated data to develop more effective and inclusive measures.

One of the biggest gaps in the agri-food sector is the lack of accurate and up-to-date data on energy consumption, which makes it difficult to make informed decisions and implement effective energy efficiency policies. In addition, technological, economic and regulatory barriers hinder the integration of renewable energies and digital technologies—such as the Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)—that have the potential to transform the sector into a more sustainable and competitive model.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
El Salvador has made considerable advances in transforming its energy matrix, with a notable 61% of its installed capacity now coming from renewable sources. This shift is part of a broader global trend towards renewable energy, driven by the desire to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, combat climate change, and promote energy independence. However, the country still faces challenges due to its hybrid energy model, which includes both public and private sector involvement. The inclusion of private sector players in the energy distribution system is contributing to high costs, which places a financial burden on consumers and the economy.

The situation is further complicated by the growing energy demand in rural areas, which is expected to rise as agricultural productivity and tourism expand. While there has been impressive progress in providing energy coverage—reaching 96.6% of rural areas in 2023—closing the remaining gap is expensive and resource-intensive.

Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
The widespread use of plastic bags in plant production contributes significantly to environmental degradation through waste accumulation, soil contamination and microplastic pollution. The challenge is to move away from these single-use plastics to sustainable, environmentally friendly alternatives that provide the necessary protection and functionality for plant growth, while ensuring cost effectiveness and long-term agricultural sustainability.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
In Cape Verde, the excessive use of plastic bags in the plant production sector, whether endemic, forestry or fruit trees, is a major environmental challenge.
Historically, the use of non-biodegradable single-use plastic bags in the plant production sector has been widely promoted in the archipelago due to their easy availability, ease of use, affordable cost and lack of knowledge about sustainable alternatives.
The reliance on the use of these plastic bags in nurseries has contributed to increased pollution and potential degradation of sensitive ecosystems and habitats, such as those found in the country's network of protected areas.
It is therefore proposed to promote the search for sustainable alternatives and innovative solutions that will bring about a radical change of direction with the aim of minimizing and even eliminating the use of single-use plastics in plant production, in line with the national policy on plastics management.

Cape Verde has banned the use of single-use plastics from 31 December 2024. From 18 May 2025, the introduction of single-use plastic products into the national market will also be banned.
The measure was taken to reduce environmental impact and promote more sustainable practices.
Some data on the use of plastics in Cape Verde:
Plastics make up almost a third of the waste in Cape Verde's landfills.
Plastics can take between 100 and 500 years to decompose in nature.
Improper disposal of plastics can pollute oceans, rivers and soil.
Plastic incineration can release toxic gases.
The list of banned plastic materials includes
Non-recyclable or non-biodegradable carrier bags
Disposable tableware
Bottles smaller than half a litre
Polystyrene containers for food and drink
Disposable cutlery and plates
Balloon sticks



In Cape Verde, several subtle but telling signals are pointing to the growing urgency of reducing the use of plastic bags in crop production. This urgency is further underlined by the recent government mandate to ban single-use plastics by 31 December 2024. This regulation reinforces the need to transition to sustainable alternatives in line with national environmental policies. Below are some qualitative indicators of this urgent challenge:

Community observations and concerns:
Local residents and agricultural workers have observed growing accumulations of plastic waste around plant nurseries and near protected ecosystems. This visible pollution, coupled with growing public dissatisfaction, points to an urgent need for environmentally friendly alternatives, especially in light of the upcoming ban.

Environmental impact reports:
Environmental inspectors and local NGOs have reported that plastic bags are increasingly affecting soil quality and the health of fragile ecosystems. The degradation of natural habitats, particularly those within Cape Verde's network of protected areas, highlights the immediate environmental risks posed by continued plastic use.

Learnings on your challenge
null
What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 
• Most of the judges (58.54%) have heard more than 20 cases in the last year, indicating a high procedural burden in provinces such as Guayas and Pichincha.
• The interviews and surveys carried out show a general perception of inefficiency and lack of speed in case management, which reinforces the need for training and improvement in judicial procedures.
• Lack of familiarization with key policies, such as the Comprehensive Gender Policy in the Administration of Justice, was identified as a critical area requiring attention.
• 30 (41%) judges have received more than 20 hours of training; 16 (22%) 5-10 hours; 14 (19%) from 11-20 hours and 13 (18%) less than 5 hours; however, there is no evaluation of training processes when it is crucial to determine specific needs and design effective programs. Most courses were delivered virtually (59), followed by a combination  of virtual and in-person (12). This suggests the need to evaluate the
effectiveness of training modalities and their learning impact.
• The main topics addressed in the training include laws and policies on gender violence (35), gender focus in judicial decisions (29), and awareness and prevention of gender violence (25); however, only 12 judges have received training in victim intervention and support methods, which could indicate a significant area for improvement.

Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)
Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

Can you provide more detail on your handover process?
Because we measured (evaluated) results from training process and there was an increase in knowledge and awareness, the course will be replicated in two more provinces. Also, the Judicial Council School will integrate a virtual modality into its official curriculum that is nationwide and mandatory for all Judges. We will be creating the virtual modality with mentors this 2025.

Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?
The diagnosis triangulates data, as we parted from a hypothesis that  there´s always a gap between ""theoretical reporting"" to actual
behaviour. That is, we wanted to contrast information provided by  interviews and surveys, to actually see if this was coherent with
verdicts (behaviour).

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is that many of our small islander's specially the vulnerable community are experiencing uncertainty of lives and livelihood due to climate change and natural hazards every year. Along with this many of the coastal islanders are in threat of joblessness and stress due to the sea level rise. But this coastal community has unseen potential to cope up with the challenges and look for alternative livelihood options.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Bangladesh’s coastal regions have long been vulnerable to natural disasters due to their geographical location. The country’s 710 km coastline is frequently impacted by cyclones, storm surges, and flooding. Historical records show devastating cyclones, such as those in 1970 and 1988, 1988, which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Over the decades, the increasing frequency and intensity of these disasters have been linked to climate change, rising sea levels, and degraded natural defenses like mangrove forests. The coastal regions of Bangladesh face a persistent cycle of disasters, including cyclones (e.g., Cyclone Amphan in 2020), tidal floods, and saltwater intrusion. While disaster preparedness has improved over the years with better early warning systems and cyclone shelters, challenges remain in ensuring resilience. Many embankments are breached annually, displacing thousands. The salinization of agricultural land has reduced crop yields, while coastal erosion destroys homes and infrastructure. Data from Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016 says 24.1% of households in the river char areas and 26% of households in the coastal char lands earn less than Tk. 7,000 monthly, while the national figure stands at 22.6%. People of the island generally remains underprivileged as they lack alternative livelihoods and fall under extreme poverty due to sudden natural calamities

Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) showed that Between 1980 and 2020, Bangladesh experienced over 200 cyclones, with an increasing trend in both frequency and intensity. Recent examples include Cyclone Sidr (2007), which caused over 3,000 fatalities, and Cyclone Amphan (2020), which resulted in damages exceeding $13 billion (USD). Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) said that over 50% of coastal land in Bangladesh is affected by saltwater intrusion, reducing agricultural productivity by 15-20% annually. and crop yields for staples like rice have declined significantly in saline-prone areas, contributing to food insecurity for millions. However, it is a common phenomenon that the char dwellers always fight with the hunger, poverty, illiteracy, less farm productivity, climatic disaster, etc. Island people are poor, illiterate and deprived of employment opportunities and health facilities. According to World Bank, nearly 12 million people live in poverty in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. The existing fearful living of char dwellers and livelihood conditions, for instance, vulnerabilities arising from natural disasters such as flood, erosion, storm, cyclone, tidal surge; poverty, which is 2.7 times higher than the national average, and its consequent malnutrition; illiteracy; inadequate education, health and sanitation services; and limited rights to, if not absence of, land and livelihood resources, leave them in a never ending fight for survival. The means for improving upon them still remains ambiguous.[4]

The nation is enhanced by unparalleled natural beauty and a wildlife sanctuary amidst the little islands. However, it is surprising that these islands' potential is still hidden and that the islanders are not benefiting from it. The unprecedented environmental shock and limited opportunities for alternative livelihoods have put their lives in jeopardy. They don't have any specific business to support their family, except than farming and fishing. Usually, they barely make ends meet. Furthermore, due to their remoteness and inadequate infrastructure, the small island regions with their many issues are unable to participate in the advancement of global growth, leaving their economies in the dark. Given how serious these issues are, it is



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The AccLab has strong ties to the public and commercial sectors, as well as other UNDP initiatives that are actively working on small island sustainable development. Because of its special location, the lab can act as a link between various organizations by creating a framework for multi-layered collaboration. Nonetheless, the Lab has previously focused on informal economy and alternative livelihood projects that combine Bangladeshi coastal regions' blue tourism. We will therefore be able to use the lessons learnt in small islands thanks to the extensive experience. Supporting our cooperative strategy in tiny islands shows a dedication to poverty alleviation and sustainable development, blue-tourism promotion, capacity building, and the promotion of local ownership and responsible governance for the long-term success of the region.

Learnings on your challenge

What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 
Engagement and ""face to face"" is crucial for building trust: The participatory mapping process helped highlight the importance of involving community members, as well as local store owners, and public sector employees in discussions about their safety and needs. Active involvement of residents and local actors fosters trust, a key element in overcoming the fragmentation of social cohesion in the neighborhood.

Barriers to safety are multifaceted: The mapping identified various physical and socioeconomic barriers that hindered the sense of safety in Barrio Norte, such as poorly maintained public spaces, lack of lighting, areas of high violence, but also higher income areas where people felt excluded to go. Understanding these barriers allowed for the identification of priorities for improvement based on local concerns.

Local knowledge is essential for contextualizing interventions: Community insights, stories, and local perspectives provided a valuable lens for designing interventions. Residents had a nuanced understanding of their own challenges, which allowed the team to tailor recommendations to the specific needs, dynamics and history of the area, ensuring higher relevance and potential impact.

Degradation of public spaces contributes to social isolation: The participatory mapping revealed how the design and maintenance of public spaces in Barrio Norte contribute to social fragmentation. Lack of accessible, shared spaces for interaction makes it difficult for residents to come together, further deepening the sense of isolation and mistrust.

Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
By combining citizen-generated data and crowd mapping, we were able to directly capture the lived experiences and concerns of the community, ensuring that the insights were rooted in the perspectives of those most affected by the challenges of safety and social cohesion.

Georeferencing and social cartography allowed us to map not just the physical spaces but also the intangible dynamics of the neighborhood, such as areas of social exclusion or trust deficits, which helped identify patterns that were not immediately apparent through conventional data. This spatial understanding provided actionable insights for designing interventions that are both contextually relevant and effective in reducing fragmentation.

The integration of community asset mapping highlighted the strengths within the community, showcasing resources and networks that could be leveraged to address the challenges at hand, thus shifting the focus from problems to opportunities. Through ethnography and participatory design, we ensured that the community was actively involved in shaping the solutions, fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration. These methods also provided deep insights into the social fabric of Barrio Norte, revealing complexities like local power dynamics and informal social structures that might have been overlooked in more conventional approaches."

Learnings on your challenge
null
What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1- Horizon scanning is a systematic, ongoing process that goes beyond mainstream news to identify ""weak signals"" and interconnected drivers of change.  It is possible to “merakyatkan foresight” (make the foresight process and jargon relatable to everyday people)

2- Launching small-scale pilots allows for real-world testing, feedback collection, and rapid refinement. It does not have to start with a project, the way we design a workshop is a good entry point for design thinking

3- Inclusive community workshops, causal layered analysis (CLA), and co-creation processes empower diverse voices, ensuring horizontal scanning insights are grounded in the realities of stakeholders like indigenous communities and youths​

Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level

Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Handover to CO MY colleagues through a brownbag and this toolkit in hardcopies and softcopies

Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The Innovation Toolkit (Accelerator Lab Malaysia 2024) redefines horizon scanning as a systematic, ongoing process rather than a one-time exercise, addressing widespread misconceptions about foresight. It emphasizes gathering weak signals and exploring multiple possible futures to develop proactive, adaptive strategies.

A groundbreaking feature is its integration of multiple data sources, combining conventional datasets like government statistics with unconventional ones, such as citizen-generated social media data and geospatial. This comprehensive approach ensures richer, more inclusive insights.

The toolkit also pioneers a cost-efficient horizon scanning system, leveraging accessible tools while minimizing reliance on costly infrastructure. Lessons learnt in engaging diverse stakeholders in Malaysia’s context ensures outputs are credible, context-specific, and grounded in real-world challenges.

By blending innovation with inclusivity and practicality, this approach sets a new standard for UNDP Malaysia, positioning it as  as a development leader of choice,  that knows the best way of policy advisory and solutions testing for sustainable development."

BIG BET

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Our challenge is to enhance the resilience and sustainability of food systems in Jordan by addressing the intertwined challenges of humanitarian needs, peacebuilding, and development.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
In Jordan, over 53% of the population faces food insecurity, exacerbated by climate change, droughts, and temperature fluctuations. The country’s dependence on food imports and resource scarcity, especially water, worsens the situation. The large refugee population also strains resources, with marginalized groups, such as women, youth, and refugees, disproportionately affected. These groups often play critical roles in food systems but face limited access to resources and opportunities, leading to poor nutrition, poverty, and environmental degradation. UNDP is working with the Food and Agriculture Commodity Systems (FACS) team, the Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery for Building Resilience (DRT) team, and the UNDP Resilience Hub for Africa in Nairobi to address these challenges.





Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
The Accelerator Lab adds unique value by leveraging experimentation before scaling, reducing risks and optimizing resources. Our approach is grounded in extensive research, including deep listening, radio mining, literature review, and stakeholder mapping, ensuring we address challenges with evidence-based, context-specific solutions. Unlike other actors, we specialize in rapid testing, co-creation, and collective intelligence, making us uniquely positioned to design impactful, scalable interventions.

Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
We're working to enhance food system resilience in Jordan's Jordan Valley by addressing food insecurity through gender-responsive, sustainable solutions. The project empowers women, youth, and marginalized groups, fostering collaboration and building resilience to climate challenges.

We analyzed existing literature, studies, and public records to identify key indicators of air pollution and their sources. This allowed us to create a dataset that filled the gap in localized, actionable information about air quality and its contributors.\n\nEngagement with UN Volunteers (UNVs):\n\nA unique aspect of this project was the development of methods to engage UNVs in data collection and validation. UNVs played a crucial role in sourcing and curating open data, applying a consistent methodology to ensure quality. This approach not only enriched the dataset but also empowered local communities to contribute directly to the initiative.\n\nUtilizing Open Data Sources:\n\nThe dataset was generated entirely using open information available online. This approach ensured transparency and replicability, enabling other regions or teams to adopt similar methodologies. Every piece of information was carefully referenced, ensuring credibility and traceability.\n\nAddressing Data Gaps:\n\nLack of Granular and Localized Data: Existing datasets often lacked detail specific to North Macedonia, such as hyperlocal pollution sources or seasonal trends. By curating open data and involving local stakeholders, we bridged this gap.\n\nInsufficient Publicly Available Datasets: Many datasets were fragmented or locked behind paywalls.

Here's how these methods proved essential and effective:\n\nHuman-Centered Design (HCD):\n\nWhy Necessary: Air pollution impacts diverse groups differently, and existing interventions often lacked alignment with community needs.\n\nImpact: HCD ensured that the voices of those directly affected—residents, local authorities, and community organizations—were integrated into the solution design. This participatory approach revealed localized behaviors (e.g., reliance on wood-burning stoves) and perceptions that were not immediately evident in existing data.\n\nOpen Data Utilization and Crowdsourcing:\n\nWhy Necessary: Publicly available data on air quality was often fragmented, outdated, or inaccessible, leaving critical gaps in understanding pollution patterns.\n\nImpact: By leveraging open data and crowdsourcing efforts with UNVs, the project created a comprehensive dataset that illuminated pollution hotspots and seasonal trends. This method also revealed systemic issues such as inconsistent data sharing practices and limited public awareness of pollution levels.\n\nRapid Prototyping and Testing:\n\nWhy Necessary: Traditional policy and intervention design processes are often slow and disconnected from ground realities. Rapid iteration was needed to create timely and practical solutions.\n\nSystems Thinking:\n\nWhy Necessary: Air pollution is a symptom of interconnected systems, including urban planning, transportation, industrial practices, and individual behaviors. Addressing it required a holistic approach.\n\nImpact: Systems mapping helped identify key leverage points, such as addressing traffic congestion during peak hours or advocating for cleaner industrial practices. It also highlighted policy gaps, such as the lack of enforcement for emissions standards.\n\nCollaborative Capacity Building:\n\nWhy Necessary: Sustainable solutions require empowered local actors who can continue scaling and maintaining initiatives beyond the project timeline.\n\nImpact: Engaging and training UNVs created a network of local champions who could independently collect, analyze, and share data. This capacity-building approach also unveiled systemic barriers, such as limited technical expertise and resources in local institutions.\n\nUnpacking the System:\n\nThese methods collectively enabled the project to move beyond surface-level observations and delve into the underlying dynamics of air pollution.

datasources: Social network / social media data

Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?
The types of data chosen for this initiative were carefully selected to address critical gaps in understanding air pollution and to align with the principles of transparency, accessibility, and scalability.

Data Generation through Research:

The dataset was built using a rigorous research methodology to ensure its relevance and accuracy. We analyzed existing literature, studies, and public records to identify key indicators of air pollution and their sources. This allowed us to create a dataset that filled the gap in localized, actionable information about air quality and its contributors.

Engagement with UN Volunteers (UNVs):

A unique aspect of this project was the development of methods to engage UNVs in data collection and validation. UNVs played a crucial role in sourcing and curating open data, applying a consistent methodology to ensure quality. This approach not only enriched the dataset but also empowered local communities to contribute directly to the initiative.

Utilizing Open Data Sources:

The dataset was generated entirely using open information available online. This approach ensured transparency and replicability, enabling other regions or teams to adopt similar methodologies. Every piece of information was carefully referenced, ensuring credibility and traceability.

Addressing Data Gaps:

Lack of Granular and Localized Data: Existing datasets often lacked detail specific to North Macedonia, such as hyperlocal pollution sources or seasonal trends. By curating open data and involving local stakeholders, we bridged this gap.

Insufficient Publicly Available Datasets: Many datasets were fragmented or locked behind paywalls. By using open information, we demonstrated that impactful solutions could be built without relying on proprietary data.

Engagement-Driven Insights: Traditional datasets often missed community-level insights, such as behavioral patterns contributing to pollution. Engaging UNVs added depth to the data by integrating these perspectives.

Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?
The complex and multifaceted nature of air pollution as a frontier challenge required the application of innovative methods to uncover root causes, identify leverage points, and design actionable solutions. Here's how these methods proved essential and effective:

Human-Centered Design (HCD):

Why Necessary: Air pollution impacts diverse groups differently, and existing interventions often lacked alignment with community needs.

Impact: HCD ensured that the voices of those directly affected—residents, local authorities, and community organizations—were integrated into the solution design. This participatory approach revealed localized behaviors (e.g., reliance on wood-burning stoves) and perceptions that were not immediately evident in existing data.

Open Data Utilization and Crowdsourcing:

Why Necessary: Publicly available data on air quality was often fragmented, outdated, or inaccessible, leaving critical gaps in understanding pollution patterns.

Impact: By leveraging open data and crowdsourcing efforts with UNVs, the project created a comprehensive dataset that illuminated pollution hotspots and seasonal trends. This method also revealed systemic issues such as inconsistent data sharing practices and limited public awareness of pollution levels.

Rapid Prototyping and Testing:

Why Necessary: Traditional policy and intervention design processes are often slow and disconnected from ground realities. Rapid iteration was needed to create timely and practical solutions.

Systems Thinking:

Why Necessary: Air pollution is a symptom of interconnected systems, including urban planning, transportation, industrial practices, and individual behaviors. Addressing it required a holistic approach.

Impact: Systems mapping helped identify key leverage points, such as addressing traffic congestion during peak hours or advocating for cleaner industrial practices. It also highlighted policy gaps, such as the lack of enforcement for emissions standards.

Collaborative Capacity Building:

Why Necessary: Sustainable solutions require empowered local actors who can continue scaling and maintaining initiatives beyond the project timeline.

Impact: Engaging and training UNVs created a network of local champions who could independently collect, analyze, and share data. This capacity-building approach also unveiled systemic barriers, such as limited technical expertise and resources in local institutions.

Unpacking the System:

These methods collectively enabled the project to move beyond surface-level observations and delve into the underlying dynamics of air pollution. By combining data-driven insights with human-centered perspectives, we were able to identify not only the symptoms but also the structural and behavioral drivers of the problem, paving the way for more effective, scalable, and sustainable interventions.

Learnings on your challenge
null
What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 
The Biohacking Laboratory as a Model for Community-Driven Innovation, that can be easily replicated; 



With the biohacking laboratory in the City of Skopje, we have developed a replicable model for integrating innovation with education, bridging scientific research, citizen participation, and entrepreneurship. The lab is empowering communities by focusing on biowaste, as a resource that is connecting scientific exploration to tangible local issues, promoting practical, community-driven solutions. Lastly the Biohacking Laboratory offers a blueprint for fostering innovation through community-oriented, inclusive spaces. It highlights how accessible, education-focused interventions can catalyze systemic change and inspire similar initiatives across sectors, starting from biowaste.

Through Targeted Support create new businesses


The ""Biohack My World"" program highlighted the untapped entrepreneurial potential of biowaste management and teams working with biotechnologies. This learning emerged after program implementation, particularly when observing how participants transitioned from conceptual ideas and MVPs to practical, scalable solutions. The second ranked team BioHive exemplified this learning. In the biohacking laboratory with our expert’s help they created lethal skin out of kombucha leftover and went to raise additional 90k$ investments from various private and institutional donors. They even won the Startup of the Year award for Macedonia as well as were winners of the Founder Games. Their innovative approach to transforming biowaste into biodegradable product showcased how startups can tackle environmental challenges while unlocking new markets and business opportunities.
 
Biowaste as art
The creation of Skopje’s first city souvenir from biowaste, crafted as part of the Biohacking Laboratory initiative, demonstrated the potential to merge sustainability with cultural expression; The
souvenir became a tangible example of circular economy principles, transforming waste into a value-added product. Furthermore, it had cultural and Economic significance as it not only promoted Skopje’s culture but also introduced an eco-friendly product into the market, supporting green entrepreneurship

Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)
Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level

Can you provide more detail on your handover process?
All the materials and the biohacking lab has been transferred to the City of Skopje. The City has also fundraised additional finances from Bloomberg Philanthropy for the biohacking lab programs from 2025.

Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

For the biowaste souvenir  it took 2 biotechnicians and 1 industrial designed more than 6 months to develop the world’s first souvenir created entirely from the biowaste a city produces that can be easily replicated by non professionals. In the first phase detailed mapping and waste valorization of three enterprises of the City was conducted. The second phase proposed methods for cellulose extraction from green biowaste using alkali delignification, and natural delignification. In the third phase the industrial designer had to create ways how this material extracted from the biowaste can be made into a souvenir.

We created first of a kind souvenir made entirely from biowaste created out of City of Skopje and the touristic department needs to take it forward

Is this a new and unusual partner for UNDP?
Yes

Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
The interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data, and unconventional partnerships within the biohacking lab and biotechnologies pilot program created a unique environment for learning and insight generation that would have been impossible through traditional approaches.

We originally proposed only SMES and entrepreneurs with tested solutions, but in deliberation we decided to expand to explore a broader diversity of applications. It was good to see the landscape of what emerged but made the competition un-balanced as the different solutions where in different stages that showed stark differences. The winner was a local government, which based on the criteria evaluation resulted as such, but perhaps it could have been a separate category of solutions to apply (local governments as a sole category, for example)\n\n\nClarity in the process, the criteria and the selection of the jury: The Escalaton process had a clear timeline and structure, but the previously mentioned learnings on the diversity of solutions that applied showed how it is important to focus on a particular category or 'niche' of actors to make the overall criteria more coherent. The diversity of actors is also important on bringing multiple perspectives and values in the evaluation process during the 2 rounds of evaluation. We had representation from the Ministry of Environment, Audubon Americas, the Industrial Syndicate and UNDP Panama, which was also important in the decision-making process. \n\n\nProvide feedback to solutions: as part of the process, we also included 2 pre-sessions, one for the pitch and one for the pre-selected solutions for the final round at the Escalaton Summit. In addition, we included a feedback session to share the feedback from the jury back to the solutions and the solutions to share feedback back to us, this was important to collect the learnings for improvements in future efforts of this nature.\n\n\nFollow up on the winner and how to build ecosystems: in the upcoming 3 months, we will follow up on the winner solution, test what work and what does not and how it can connect to broader ecosystems efforts. More than a winner, we were looking for cases to explore and continue to grow circularity efforts for plastics in Panama."", ""name"": null, ""type"": ""txt"", ""level"": ""media"", ""fontsize"": 1, ""required"": true, ""fontstyle"": ""normal"", ""textalign"": ""left"", ""constraint"": 0, ""fontweight"": ""normal"", ""is_excerpt"": false, ""has_content"": true, ""instruction"": ""What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Learnings on your challenge

What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 
Going beyond the winner: there are no silver bullets, the Escalaton was a way to articulate and visualize the efforts of diverse actors in the ecosystem, while also generating incentives for new solutions identified to connect and engage in a space with investors and enablers that could support solutions to scale. 


A great diversity of solutions, but it is better to focus on a niche: we received 34 applications to the process, with a great diversity of solutions from entrepreneurs, academia, NGOs and even local governments, whoever, that same diversity made it challenging to compare across the particularities and nature of the solutions that participated. We originally proposed only SMES and entrepreneurs with tested solutions, but in deliberation we decided to expand to explore a broader diversity of applications. It was good to see the landscape of what emerged but made the competition un-balanced as the different solutions where in different stages that showed stark differences. The winner was a local government, which based on the criteria evaluation resulted as such, but perhaps it could have been a separate category of solutions to apply (local governments as a sole category, for example)


Clarity in the process, the criteria and the selection of the jury: The Escalaton process had a clear timeline and structure, but the previously mentioned learnings on the diversity of solutions that applied showed how it is important to focus on a particular category or 'niche' of actors to make the overall criteria more coherent. The diversity of actors is also important on bringing multiple perspectives and values in the evaluation process during the 2 rounds of evaluation. We had representation from the Ministry of Environment, Audubon Americas, the Industrial Syndicate and UNDP Panama, which was also important in the decision-making process. 


Provide feedback to solutions: as part of the process, we also included 2 pre-sessions, one for the pitch and one for the pre-selected solutions for the final round at the Escalaton Summit. In addition, we included a feedback session to share the feedback from the jury back to the solutions and the solutions to share feedback back to us, this was important to collect the learnings for improvements in future efforts of this nature.


Follow up on the winner and how to build ecosystems: in the upcoming 3 months, we will follow up on the winner solution, test what work and what does not and how it can connect to broader ecosystems efforts. More than a winner, we were looking for cases to explore and continue to grow circularity efforts for plastics in Panama.

Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)
Our work has not yet scaled

Can you provide more detail on your handover process?
We are still documenting the learnings on this process, but there is strong interest by actors in the ecosystem to continue these efforts, specially from entrepreneurs that often find many roadblocks in terms of formalization, financing and access to markets. More on this coming soon.

Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your ""big bet"" or ""exploratory"" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.
EXPLORATORY

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
If you look around, you'll see plastic everywhere. Without going too far, you're probably reading this on your phone, tablet, or laptop, all of which contain plastic components. It's a material that has revolutionized our daily lives and seems to make everything easier. However, this convenience comes at a cost: just look at the rivers and streams in Panama City to see how tons of waste, mostly plastic, end up in the ocean. Or consider the fires at Cerro Patacón, our city's landfill and open-air dumps that make it hard for us to breathe. It's essential to shift from a produce, consume, and dispose model to a plastic circle that protects our ecosystems and our health.

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
At least 91% of the plastics we import are final products: flip-flops, containers, tables, or chairs. Between 2015 and 2019 alone, Panama imported an annual average of 160,704 tons of plastic raw materials, yet we lack sufficient environmentally responsible systems and mechanisms to manage and dispose of them at the end of their lifecycle. We need innovative solutions to create a circular system that prevents plastic pollution. This is why UNDP is exploring various starting points to accelerate the transition toward a circular economy.

Since 2021, UNDP Panama and its accelerator lab has supported solutions mapping, collective intelligence and experimentation efforts on the issue of plastics circularity, resulting on the weaving of relationships and connections within the ecosystems, specially through efforts such as PechaKucha, where we first organized a 'Plastic Circle' activity with the support of the AccLab of Perú. 

This effort resulted on Audobon Americas continuing this tradition to invite solutions to Plastic Circle vol. 2 in the Plastics Symposium in 2024, as part of the Blue Natural Heritage project, it included a bootcamp for circular solutions on plastics with the support of Escala Latam, with whom at the time we identified as an actor that could dynamize and identify ways to unlock financing towards circular solutions created by local actors in Panama.

Panama is one of the biggest plastic generators per capita in the Latin American region, several studies from JICA (2001) to INECO (2017) and the recent baseline study on plastics (Ministry of Environment, 2024) show how plastics is the second most generated material in Panama after organic waste, while we do not have proper systems in place to manage it. Other analysis, such as the one on imports and exports of plastics and rubber show a sneak peek on the complexity of this issue and the need to take urgent action from global to local levels.



Through the solutions mapping process, we identified a niche of solutions that come from private sector, entrepreneurs, businesses and academia that could enhance the transition towards circular systems for plastics at a local level, at the same time, we identified that key initiatives for plastics circularity such as the Blue/Natural Heritage project could be articulated to better support entrepreneurial, local efforts.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
In the context of the National Platics Action Partnership (NPAP) led by the Ministry of Environment in Panama, there was a need to showcase and dynamize local solutions that align with the NPAP objectives, given that the AccLab has previously supported solutions mapping on plastics, collective intelligence efforts and experimentation on this topic, we were asked to design this innovation challenge. We were uniquely positioned to work on this given that we could articulate the ecosystem and dynamize this innovation challenge with the expertise of Escala Latam, which was launching a series of 'Escalatones' on a diversity of sustainability issues, in a way, we 'weaved' existing relationships and momentum through this process in a way that builds something bigger than the sum of its parts.

Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
The intention is to continue to weave the ecosystem of actors in the plastics circularity domain, more than finding a 'winner' or 'silver bullet' the idea is to showcase and celebrate solutions, articulate them with key policies and identify ways to unlock financing for circular initiatives at scale. We are also exploring the opportunity to launch a similar challenge focused on food systems and municipal markets, which will build on the learnings from this Plastic Circle Escalaton."

What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 
The following are some insights from the initial workshops with community leaders and communication areas of the government:

- LACK OF UNAWARENESS REGARDING MISINFORMATION: Despite hearing the term ""infodemics"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, community leaders were unaware of the problem's persistence, the terms disinformation and misinformation, or its effects on public life.

- THE BURDEN OF NEWS VERIFICATION FOR INDIVIDUALS: Community leaders consider efficient news delivery vital for both security and everyday decision-making (for example, it would be helpful to have some examples of decisions they make). However, individuals face a significant challenge in verifying the accuracy of all received news, which is an extremely time-consuming process. They need tools that help them access reliable information. 

- VULNERABILITY TO POOR INFORMATION INTEGRITY IS ASYMMETRICAL AMONG POPULATIONS: How people access and consume information varies greatly depending on who they are. Factors like their age, gender, the language they speak (especially for Indigenous populations), whether they have disabilities, and their level of education all play a role. For example, women expressed that in households it is common that men are the ones accessing information and making calls based on it that involves the family, like what is allowed or what measures are going to be taken.

- INTER-MINISTERIAL COLLABORATION FOR EFFECTIVE SECURITY COMMUNICATION: A key element for an effective communication strategy around security issues is fostering an environment where comms teams can thrive. This needs strong coordination among all involved ministries, clearly defined protocols, capacity building initiatives, and the unequivocal endorsement of the head of each ministry. Effective communication must be prioritized at the highest levels of each ministry to empower their respective comms teams. 

- IN THE FACE OF EVENTS, A LAG IN COMMUNICATION CAN DEEPEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS: In the face of sudden security issues—e.g., attacks by organized crime—citizens need immediate reassurance from their government that action is being taken, even if the details are still being confirmed. Slow government responses generate doubt and uncertainty, conveying the image that the government is not equipped to protect its citizens. Meanwhile, people look for information elsewhere.

Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)
Our work has not yet scaled

Can you provide more detail on your handover process?
The project is still ongoing and a last cocreation workshop will be held in Februrary with local traditional and emergent media outlets. In March a public presentation of the results will include NGOs, private sector and general audience.

The handover process includes currently working on this initiative with the Governance Unit, so when the pilots are ready to scale UNDP is ready for the task.

Learnings on your challenge
null
What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 
1. The free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) process conducted as part of this initiative was crucial in establishing trust within the communities and highlighted the importance of acknowledging and including indigenous governance structures in decision-making processes. In the case of the Emberá-Wounaan Territory, their participation and the integration of indigenous knowledge in designing solutions to the migration crisis in Darién are essential. 

2. It is key to understand the historical trajectory of these communities to address the current migration crisis. Active listening during the creation of the Canaán and Bajo Chiquito timeline demonstrated the role of memory in understanding the various dynamics of social cohesion and collective action that have influenced the lives of both communities. These are also starting points for more effective solutions that strengthen the social fabric and resilience at the local level, linking humanitarian aid, peace, and development. 

3. A futures &amp; foresight approach is needed to anticipate the differentiated effects that changes in migration flows have on host communities, with a gender-focused approach. Within the dynamics that emerged during the active listening process, cultural changes, including shifts in the relationship with livelihoods, reflected the varied impacts migration has had on women, youth, and older adults.

Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)
Our work has not yet scaled

Can you provide more detail on your handover process?
This process was conducted for about 7 months, starting in december 2023 y and ending in june 2024. The documentation (blogs &amp; policy note) are now being diffused and we are exploring the linkages between these learnings and other potential projects related to environmental governance in the Darien region.

Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

datasources: focus group
datasources: free, prior and informed consent
datasources: social cartography

Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?
We used the most recent census data as baseline (2023), given that most of the data on these communities rely on estimates. However, even that data could be contested due to the complex nature of the communities of Bajo Chiquito and Canaán. In addition, we used the census data to include a multidimentional poverty analysis on the corregimiento of Lajas Blancas, where both communities are located. 

The whole process was conducted under a Free, Prior and Informed Consent approach, which showed how it is not a 'procedure to be followed', but a vehicle to build trust with indigenous authorities and local communities, aligning in intentions and the objectives of the process to the community needs and what could be of best use for them. 

Under the free, prior and informed consent along the process, we also conducted   active (deep) listening activies where we did in-depth interviews and focus groups with community members, as well as community mappings (social cartography) and the documentation of the oral history of the community, the objective was to explore alternative worldviews, narratives and solutions from the perspective of the communities of Bajo Chiquito and Canaán.

Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
In this case, there was a lot of existing data on migration, we identified the need to better articulate the case of the 'development element' in the humanitarian, peace and development nexus. We did it by bringing in multidimensional poverty insights and data, but more than that, we brought in the perspectives of Canaán and Bajo Chiquito through the ethnographic process, which also explored and elevated alternative starting points to strengthen a development perspective on this complex issue."

What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 
Durante 4 días de trabajo, 12 equipos conformados por diversos actores del ecosistema de aseguramiento participaron en el reto de innovación para diseñar una solución costo eficiente de aseguramiento para los pequeños alojamientos en Colombia. Participaron aseguradoras, reaseguradoras, canales de comercialización, microfinancieras, banca tradicional, fintech, insurtech, asociaciones de turismo, entre otras, las cuales hicieron alianzas para diseñar productos innovadores haciendo uso de la inteligencia colectiva, construyendo sobre visiones diversas y abordando los desafíos que enfrentan los pequeños alojamientos del país de una manera innovadora.

También participación de más de 10 entidades aliadas como mentores, expertos temáticos y acompañantes del proceso, contribuyeron al diseño de soluciones integrales, que tienen en cuenta los dolores de los pequeños alojamientos y sus usuarios, así como las oportunidades y cuellos de botella desde el punto de vista del mercado, la política pública y de regulación.

Entre las propuestas presentadas se destaca el diseño de productos innovadores con seguros paramétricos, embebidos y modulares, que de manera general incluyen valores agregados, programas de educación financiera, enfoque de género y estrategias dinámicas para su comercialización a partir de la promoción de la conectividad de los pequeños alojamientos.

Dentro de los insights más relevantes del proceso se encuentran:
- La participación activa de los usuarios reales permitió generar una mayor empatía y conocimiento de los dolores de los usuarios al tener a los dueños de los pequeños alojamientos como mentores y evaluadores en el proceso
- La inteligencia colectiva permitió lograr soluciones más integrales, valorando el conocimiento y redes de cada uno de los participantes de los grupos solucionadores.
- La interacción de métodos, los datos y socios inusuales facilitó la generación de ideas innovadoras y permitió una comprensión mucho más profunda de las necesidades de los usuarios y del contexto de mercado.
- Existe una oportunidad de mercado y una necesidad de desarrollo que actualmente esta siendo desatendida. A través del reto, las empresas logran entender las necesidades reales de los usuarios y diseñan un producto que se ajusta a sus necesidades y que será puesto en el mercado el primer semestre del 2025.


 Éstas son las iniciativas que quedaron seleccionadas en el primer y segundo puesto:
-Banco Agrario- Axa Colpatria - Correcol: Seguro embebido enfocado en la protección integral del pequeño hotel en su infraestructura; protección de la estadía segura del cliente a través de un seguro para mascota mientras vacaciona y protección de la atención de la salud de un extranjero; y un seguro para el empleado del hotel enfocado en su bienestar social.
-Seguros SURA: Seguro embebido para pequeños hoteles enfocado en daños materiales, daños a terceros, incidentes cibernéticos, con una estrategia de digitalización, educación financiera y formalización.

Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
En el marco del reto, la combinación de métodos de innovación, nuevas formas de datos y socios inusuales permitió:
- Generar una mayor empatía y conocimiento de los dolores de los usuarios al tener a los dueños de los pequeños alojamientos como mentores en el proceso
- Generar sinergias para lograr soluciones más integrales, valorando el conocimiento y redes de cada uno de los participantes de los grupos solucionadores.

En general, la interacción de métodos, los datos y socios inusuales facilitó la generación de ideas innovadoras y permitió una comprensión mucho más profunda de las necesidades de los usuarios y del contexto de mercado. Esta sinergia dio como resultado soluciones más ajustadas y valiosas, que de otro modo no habríamos podido alcanzar utilizando enfoques tradicionales o trabajando de manera aislada.

Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: ""Our challenge is that...”.)
Nuestro desafío es solucionar esa necesidad de aseguramiento de pequeños empresarios del sector turismo que cuentan con alojamientos ubicadas en zonas rurales y urbanas con capacidad hasta 10 habitaciones y que no se reconocen como grandes firmas hoteleras. La solución la desarrollaremos con el apoyo del ecosistema asegurador (aseguradoras, reaseguradoras, canales de comercialización, microfinancieras, fintech/insurtech, banca tradicional).

Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?
Existe una voluntad del Gobierno Nacional de fortalecer la competitividad y crecimiento del sector turismo a través de diferentes políticas, programas e incentivos relevantes. Así mismo, existe una intención de fortalecer los procesos de formalización empresarial y de sofisticar sus modelos de negocio a través de una mayor sostenibilidad y protección.

Según el Vice Ministerio de Turismo en Colombia, este tipo de actores presentan más de 70% de los prestadores de alojamiento en todo el país. Son alrededor de 18.000 pequeños que se encuentran activos ante los registros del gobierno. Normalmente están expuestos a diferentes tipos de riesgos, no cuentan con mecanismos de aseguramiento y no tienen sistemas de gestión de reservas propios, se apoyan en las plataformas ya existentes de reservas.

Entre los riesgos principales a los que están expuestos incluye:

- Daños a la infraestructura, equipamiento y perdida de ingresos como resultado de las afectaciones.

- Las actividades alternas que tienen estos alojamientos como parte de su diversificación de ingresos no están aseguradas (restaurantes, paquetes turísticos, etc).

- No todos cuentan con seguros de responsabilidad contra daños a huéspedes.

A través de encuestas preliminares se han identificado los siguientes elementos que complementan la hipotesis planteada:

- Los propietarios de los pequeños alojamientos requieren de mayores conocimientos en gestión de riesgos y en el uso de los seguros

- No existe una oferta de productos de aseguramiento dirigidos a suplir la necesidad del sector

- No se cuenta con información suficiente ara caracterizar a los microempresarios que hacen pate de este sector.

Información disponible oficial del ViceMinisterio de Turismo.

- 9.5 billones COP Aportó el turismo en el PIB en Colombia durante el primer semestre del 2023

- 4.5 millones de visitantes extranjeros reportados hasta la fecha en el 2023.

- Menos del 25% de los actores del sector turismo están innovando o invirtiendo en innovación

- 79 mil prestadores de servicios turísticos identificados al 2023.

- 63% De la población económica activa del sector no pudo contribuir a su pensión por temas de informalidad.



Se realizaron entrevistas con actores clave que nos permitió identificar que los pequeños alojamientos:

- Visibilidad en el Mercado: La competencia con grandes cadenas hoteleras puede hacer que los pequeños alojamientos enfrenten dificultades para destacar y ser visibles en el mercado.

- Recursos Financieros Limitados: La falta de recursos financieros puede limitar las inversiones en marketing, renovaciones y tecnología, afectando la calidad de los servicios ofrecidos.

- Gestión Operativa: La gestión eficiente puede ser un desafío, ya que a menudo cuentan con equipos más pequeños y recursos limitados para la formación del personal.

- Adaptación a Tecnologías: La adopción de tecnologías modernas, como sistemas de reservas en línea, puede resultar un desafío para algunos pequeños alojamientos.

Necesidades específicas frente al sector asegurador:

- Seguro Integral: Existe una necesidad fundamental de contar con seguros integrales que cubran aspectos como daños a la propiedad, responsabilidad civil, y protección para los huéspedes en caso de accidentes.

- Evaluación de Riesgos: La realización de evaluaciones de riesgos específicas para la ubicación del alojamiento, considerando posibles amenazas naturales como terremotos, inundaciones o deslizamientos, es esencial para una planificación efectiva.

- Capacitación en Manejo de Emergencias: La capacitación del personal en técnicas de manejo de emergencias y evacuación puede marcar la diferencia en la seguridad de los huéspedes y del personal en situaciones críticas.

- Infraestructura Resiliente: La necesidad de invertir en infraestructuras resilientes, diseñadas para resistir eventos naturales, es crucial para minimizar los daños en caso de desastres.

Sobre las restricciones identificadas:

- Costos de Seguros: Los costos asociados con la obtención de seguros integrales pueden representar una carga financiera considerable.

- Falta de Conciencia del sector: Algunos propietarios pueden no estar plenamente conscientes de los riesgos específicos de su ubicación o pueden subestimar la importancia de contar con seguros.

- Cumplimiento Normativo: El cumplimiento de normativas y códigos de construcción puede ser un desafío, especialmente si las regulaciones son complejas.

- Acceso a Recursos de Capacitación: La capacitación en manejo de emergencias puede ser limitada, y muchos pequeños alojamientos pueden tener dificultades para acceder a programas de formación.

- Planificación para Evacuaciones: La planificación efectiva para evacuaciones en caso de desastres naturales requiere coordinación y recursos adicionales, y muchos pequeños alojamientos pueden no contar con planes claros al respecto.



Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?
El aseguramiento para este segmento poblacional sigue siendo un desafío muy relevante. A través de metodologías innovadoras, pensamiento centrado en el usuario y la articulación con actores no convencionales para el PNUD, hacemos un llamado abierto para encontrar soluciones innovadoras por parte del sector de aseguramiento. Una de las fortalezas más claras en el rol del Laboratorio de Aceleración, fue el diseño de la metodología.
