                                           People around the world experience countless injustices. From unpaid salaries to losing a home to illegal detention. When facing troubles, where does one go to seek justice? Especially if courts are far away, legal advice is expensive and delays are painful? More than five billion people(link is external), around two-thirds of the world’s population, lack meaningful access to formal justice systems.At the same time governments and institutions are under growing pressure, with more demands and fewer resources. Justice systems are no exception. Despite playing a vital role in keeping societies fair and stable, they receive just 1.4 percent of global development assistance(link is external). But what if we could make justice work better, faster and fairer by doing things differently? Good practices are already there. UNDP’s Justice Futures CoLab and Accelerator Labs are helping surface and scale them. We piloted peer learning to enhance justice services on the ground. Innovation in actionRethinking how people experience justice is at the heart of innovation. Low-cost, people-centred initiatives are already reshaping justice services, with UNDP playing a leading role in co-developing and scaling these solutions in close partnership with national institutions and communities.In Ecuador, families affected by femicide worked with the Accelerator Lab to develop 'Flowers in the Air', a storytelling map that geolocates the stories of women who were killed. These powerful narratives are now used to train judges and prosecutors, helping shift attitudes about gender-based violence. So far, over 450 judicial officials have been trained, and the model is expanding nationwide through a new online platform.In Eswatini(link is external), long transfer times between prisons and courts have contributed to growing pre-trial detention delays. Transporting detainees for brief weekly remand appearances was resource-intensive and costly. The Accelerator Lab and governance team worked with the judiciary to design a remote remand hearing system that connects police stations, the High Court, correctional centres, and magistrate courts via secure video link. This reduced the need to transport detainees, cut costs and improved court efficiency. Crucially, the team collaborated closely with the Office of the Chief Justice to ensure the digitalized procedures fit existing legal processes. It now covers all four High Courts and is being adapted for bail and plea hearings.In the Democratic Republic of Congo, poor record-keeping and long delays were common. An in-house justice reform programme, supported by the Accelerator Lab, developed a suite of open-source tools for prison management, case tracking, criminal record issuance and staff deployment. These three tools are now live in three provinces, where clerks report search times dropping from days to minutes. Justice authorities have asked the team to prepare a scale-up plan, and it is now seeking funding to expand the approach further.

           From experiments to sustainable solutionsThese examples demonstrate that innovation works best when grounded in real life experiences and embedded in the day-to-day work of national institutions. While technology played a role, the most critical factor was the partnerships and trust built between communities, governments and justice actors.However, lasting change requires more than strong relationships and smart tools. It demands confronting deeper, systemic challenges, such as outdated regulations, imbalanced power dynamics and harmful social norms that hold justice systems back. For innovation to be sustainable it must be linked to broader reforms. Innovation also can’t happen in isolation. The most impactful initiatives emerged when justice, governance and digital development teams worked together. This delivered meaningful results at minimal cost, proving that innovation is a necessity for achieving more with less.What’s next? Looking forward, the goal is to scale what already works and build the infrastructure to sustain it. That means investing in shared tools, open digital platforms and continuous learning. The Justice Futures CoLab and Accelerator Labs will keep driving this forward, connecting innovators, amplifying country-led solutions, and exploring new areas like digital public goods and smarter ways to measure justice needs.Justice innovation isn’t a one-off experiment. It’s a long-term, collective effort to make justice more accessible, affordable and responsive for all.Ready to go further?

                                           A follow-up: from early experiments to an emerging normIn 2020, we embarked on an ambitious journey: introducing experimentation in 91 UNDP country offices as a tool for accelerating sustainable development. The premise was simple yet bold—by testing ideas in real-world contexts, learning from failures and successes, and then rapidly adapting, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network could generate evidence-based solutions to complex development challenges. Five years later, experimentation is no longer a novel approach within UNDP, it is becoming a recognized and embedded practice. The numbers speak for themselves:   
                 
            
    



        
            In our previous blog, “The Promise of Experimentation for Development,” we reflected onwhat we learned when integrating experimentation into development. Now, we examine how experimentation is transitioning from one-off projects to a norm within UNDP, how it can become fully integrated into the core of UNDP's operations and functions, and how to contribute our learnings to the broader development ecosystem. The shift from periphery to coreFor experimentation to become institutionalized, it must move from the periphery of innovation teams into the core of programs, policies and decision-making frameworks. This shift can be understood through the lens of norm dynamics(link is external), a concept from international relations that explains how new practices become standard over time.  In norm dynamics, we track the emergence of norms (usually introduced by norm entrepreneurs who advocate for its adoption), to the norm cascade (more teams adopting experimental methods, creating momentum) and finally, internalization – when experimentation becomes widely accepted and expected. One pattern is increasingly clear within the Accelerator Labs Network: experimentation is transitioning from a new, emergent practice to an embedded norm within UNDP. It is referenced in strategic documents, reflected in new partnerships and supported by senior leadership.(link is external) This shift has been actively shaped by the Labs as agents of change (norm entrepreneurs) who have intentionally created the conditions for experimentation to take root. Experimentation within UNDP has passed through its initial stages of emergence, and as more actors within the organization and its ecosystems engage with experimentation as a credible method for addressing complex development challenges, one can argue that we are well into the cascading stage. However, to reach full internalization, experimentation must become an expected and resourced function rather than an optional approach. This means securing institutional support, dedicated funding and leadership buy-in to make experimentation a standard part of problem-solving at UNDP. The next milestone- internalization - is within reach, but it will require sustained effort to fully anchor experimentation as an organizational reflex.Experimentation in practice: the line between feasibility and rigorOne of the Labs’ key learnings is managing the tension between rigor and feasibility -- balancing evidence standards with development realities. Navigating between learning and action, research and implementation, has been crucial to making experimentation both meaningful and actionable. We use the term Feasible Rigor to describe the art of generating robust evidence within the constraints of real-world development actions. Across the network, teams found that every effective experiment—regardless of theme or geography—shared four essential components:  
                  
            
    



           Essential components of experimentation       
           Depending on the level of control, these can range from highly rigorous trials (e.g., randomized food voucher pilots in Paraguay) to more adaptive experiments (e.g., community recycling programs). What matters is not perfection, but transparency and learning.In our experience, experimentation involves taking on multiple strategic functions. It is helping to revitalize a forward-looking organizational culture by embedding capabilities such as foresight—illustrated by North Macedonia’s ""Dream Labs,"" where participatory foresight became an official platform for shaping the National Development Strategy. It also plays a key role in de-risking emerging tools and technologies, as seen in Panama, where AI was used to visualize future climate scenarios, helping inform municipal resilience planning. At the same time, experimentation is generating critical insights into complex development challenges—for example, in Paraguay, where different interventions were tested(link is external) to understand their effect on public perceptions of social protection systems. These diverse applications underscore how experimentation supports more adaptive and evidence-informed development.

           Experimenting with innovative tools for development Experimenting with the goal of embedding innovative tools for development is a pattern not just within the Labs and UNDP but also across broader country ecosystems. Crowd-mapping is one such tool initially used for data collection but increasingly recognized for its ability to enhance participation and awareness.In Kenya, herder communities became “water scouts” and mapped over 1,200 water sources and 684 social amenities. In the Maldives, residents mapped island infrastructure to help manage disaster risk. Meanwhile in Guatemala, more than 400 volunteers mapped rural roads using satellite imagery, and a digital tool was developed to assess infrastructure risks from natural disasters using geographic coordinates. In North Macedonia, an open call for crowd-mapping led to the public mapping of water infrastructure in the capital, inspiring civil society organizations like the Scouts Association to replicate the experiment in another city. In Serbia, UNDP used alternative data—satellite imagery, telecom records, and citizen input—to analyze migration patterns, with findings that informed national policy.Experimentation leads to emerging themes in the sustainable development landscapeReflecting on our Network journey and codifying our work, we learned that Labs were not just running individual experiments, they were building interconnected portfolios of work, stitching together themes such as circular economy, climate resilience and inclusive governance. What began as exploratory, one-off experiments have evolved into intentional systemic portfolios, reinforcing the value of experimentation as a method for tackling complex development challenges. By visualizing these connections, the Labs unlocked new opportunities for strategic alignment and influence within UNDP, but equally important, for the ecosystems where we work. Inspired by the idea to create a global innovation commons for sustainable development, we have published all our experiments on this website, with the goal to inspire action, and potentially inspire other organizations and institutions to pursue similar functions: https://sdg-innovation-commons.org/.

           What’s Next? Experimentation as a core elementThe journey from early adoption to full internalization is ongoing. But one thing is clear: with continued commitment, experimentation is no longer just an option for development—it is becoming an expectation.Since 2020, the Labs have developed as a distributed R&D function for UNDP, producing timely, relevant, and localized insights for development programming across 115+ countries. The aim was to try out new ways of working and convert our learnings into new, practical action. The challenge for UNDP and other organizations going forward is clear: How can we ensure that experimentation moves beyond an emerging norm to become an institutionalized standard? To achieve this, we must ensure that experimentation is resourced and expected, not optional; embedded in country strategies and program cycles; and used to inform strategic shifts. As the development landscape grows more complex and uncertain, experimentation offers a path to clarity - not by providing perfect answers, but by asking the right questions, and testing what works - faster. If you are also working on experimentation in the development sector, we invite you to share your experiences, reach out to our network of Experimenters and check out our body of work in the SDG Commons(link is external)."

                                           Long before MasterChef hit the screens, Doña Petrona was already a cooking icon on Argentine television. Born in 1898, her cookbooks have sold more copies than the Bible in the country, reaching their 123rd edition, and it got translated into several languages — even Russian.In mid-20th century Argentina, millions of people learned how to use natural gas almost without realizing it. It didn’t happen through technical explanations, instruction manuals, or formal training. It happened through Doña Petrona. She never talked about valves, pressure, or energy efficiency. She taught people how to cook. And in doing so, she was also teaching them how to use a new energy source: natural gas. Making a shepherd’s pie or a homemade flan on live television became, unintentionally, a tutorial on how to light a burner, adjust the flame, or clean the stovetop. This kind of learning — rooted in everyday life and focused on what truly matters — is essential when we talk about technological innovation. Especially when that innovation is tied to basic rights, like access to energy.Between 2016 and 2017, over 4,000 solar water heaters were installed in social housing across the province of Jujuy, potentially reaching up to 16,000 people. These systems were specially designed to withstand the extreme temperature swings of the Puna region, with support from Fundación EcoAndina, an organization working with renewable energy since 1987. The goal was to harness solar energy as a tool to reduce energy poverty. This was a unique project for several reasons: its large scale, the geographic diversity of its implementation —spanning rural and urban areas, both small and large— and the wide range of infrastructure and socioeconomic conditions across the targeted communities. However, beyond the numbers and the magnitude of the logistical effort, the real question wasn’t how many devices were installed, but how many were actually used.  
           Renewable Energy: The Work of UNDP’s Co-Lab  
           Between May and June 2024, the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Argentina carried out a study to better understand the actual use of solar water heaters in social housing and the barriers to their adoption. Through surveys with 129 households, 10 in-depth interviews, and one focus group, this research offered firsthand insight into how — or why not — renewable technologies are adopted in contexts of energy poverty.The project Sun at Home: What Works to Adopt Renewable Energy in Social Housing led to a field study whose results we’re pleased to share in this report. One of the main findings was that, despite overwhelmingly positive opinions, the actual adoption of solar water heaters was quite limited: only 7% of households used it as their sole source of hot water, 35% combined it with electric or gas systems, and the remaining 58% didn’t use it at all. You can read the full report here.Among those who didn’t use the system, many never installed it, gave it away, sold it, or fully disconnected it. The reasons were varied: technical issues (like low water pressure, poor orientation that didn’t capture sunlight, or poor installation or substandard materials), unstable water networks, and precarious housing conditions.Yet the biggest obstacle was something else: there was no training or follow-up. The solar heaters were delivered without any hands-on guidance, and the only support offered was a technical manual. As a result, people were left to figure things out on their own — or, at best, rely on neighbors for help. The findings from the Jujuy experience align with others we’ve seen regarding the persistent barriers to the effective adoption of renewable energy solutions.

           What Did We Learn from the Solar Water Heater Experience in Jujuy?  
           Using a solar water heater should be as easy as frying an egg on Sunday morning. But for that to happen, you need more than just the technology — you need support. When people don’t understand how the system works, they make do. When the heater is poorly oriented, the water doesn’t get warm. When there’s no pressure, there’s not enough for a proper shower. And when no one explains what to do with the steam during summer, the device becomes a hazard instead of a solution.Even so, some users came up with their own strategies: they came up with fixes like adding drainpipes to relieve pressure and prevent boiling, installed mixers to regulate temperature, cleaned the glass panels to improve heating, adjusted usage times, and shared tips with neighbors. They learned through trial and error — and taught each other along the way.People in Jujuy learned however they could. Back in the day, Doña Petrona had been hired by Argentina’s national natural gas company to promote the shift from wood-burning stoves to natural gas. But she didn’t teach about gas. She showed people how to enjoy life more one recipe at a time.. In the case of solar water heaters, the challenge isn’t just technical — it’s cultural. It’s not enough to hand out devices: you need to be present — to listen, adapt, and truly walk alongside people. You must build trust — not just infrastructure.In innovation processes and in the promotion of new technologies, it’s essential to create experiences where people learn by doing. Ensuring the adoption of renewable energy solutions isn’t just about installing a panel or a solar water heater — it’s about understanding and supporting the routines, knowledge, and habits of those who will use them. In other words, it’s about teaching people how to use them without it feeling like a lesson. Like Doña Petrona. Like someone showing you how to fry an egg — and, without meaning to, transforming the lives of thousands of households."

                                           Cattle raiding has long been a part of the cultural landscape in Narus and Budi counties, the semi-arid borderlands of Eastern Equatoria, where tradition and tension frequently coexist. This practice, which was once guided by ancient codes of honour, has changed over time, turning into violent disagreements, conflict between communities, and the loss of livelihoods. Recognizing the urgency and complexity of the issue, the UNDP South Sudan Accelerator Lab in collaboration with the Roots of Generation (ROG), conducted a follow-up co-creation workshop designed to identify solutions from within the community.The initiative was built on an earlier visit in May 2024, when the Lab, along with staff from the UNDP- Africa Borderlands Centre (UNDP-ABC) and Life & Peace Institute, who had travelled from Kenya and Ethiopia, visited the area. The ABC is UNDP's larger assistance for cross-border peace initiatives in the Karamoja corridor, which includes South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia; a region where national borders are porous, but communities, cultures, and conflict are shared.Our trip back to Narus and Budi was more than just a continuation; it was a connection, strengthening of bonds, sharing of knowledge, and a celebration of local innovation.   
                   
            
    



           Session with Kraal leaders:  Mzee Loraca, during the Co-creation sessions in Narus.      UNDP/2025     
           Fireside Chats: Rekindling Community DialogueDuring fireside discussion moments, we gathered with elders, women, and kraal youths for open discussions. These fireside exchanges were more than just symbolic; they were strong tools for surfacing shared histories, long-standing grievances, and community aspirations. In the past, cattle exchange strengthened clan ties and fostered relationships rather than destroying them, according to the elders, who are the custodians of oral history. Young people, who are frequently held responsible for raids, talked candidly about peer pressure, the lack of job opportunities, and how raids are glorified in society.   
                   
            
    



           Women and girls:  The most unheard yet the most impacted having moments of reflection and co-creation.      UNDP/2025     
           Empathy Mapping: Seeing the InvisibleThe first seeds of understanding and reconciliation were sown from these intimate discussions, and women—often the unseen and unheard but profoundly affected—spoke about their pain, resilience, and aspirations for change. From conversation to design. We led empathy mapping sessions, which used visual aids to analyze the words, thoughts, feelings, and actions of various actors in order to uncover more hidden truths. These conversations with various community groups were incredibly eye-opening. These maps turned into mirrors, reflecting a common burden and strong desire for peace and improved livelihood among the raided families, kraal youths, elders, and women. Communities were able to visualize the overlapping pain points and motivations by mapping the perspectives of local chiefs, mothers, herders, raiders, and even the cattle themselves (a metaphor that provoked both insight and laughter).This exercise surfaced emotional intelligence, the social and psychological effects of cattle raiding. The raided felt depressed, angry, unsettled, and frequently tempted to seek retaliation. They talked about the loss of their young people who were shot in the raids or injured, widowhood, orphanhood, abandoned lands, and the loss of loved ones. Those frequently referred to as ""the other"" were humanized by this process, which changed fear into curiosity and judgment into understanding.  
                   
            
    



           Kraal Youths from Kapoeta and Budi     UNDP/2025     
           One kraal youth, Lochia Lonok, 34, from Lopua boma, reflected:""I have participated in many cattle raids. I have raided, and my cows have been raided too. I have also seen the people I love being killed during cattle raids. There is nothing to gain in cattle raiding except for regrets. I really want us to stop this practice.""But things are starting to change. Elders are telling their sons that raiding holds no value, urging them instead to sell cattle for business, and to ""cut the chain of cattle raids by taking all children to school.”On the flipside of things, the empathy maps also showed how raiders are frequently praised, which feeds a vicious cycle of pride and suffering: ""The youth who raided felt great and felt praised in their communities.""    
                
           Persona Reflections: Voices from the Ground1.  Women and Girls in Kapoeta and BudiAged 21–45 and ranging from housewives to peace committee members, many of these women have lived in their communities for years. They described the consequences of cattle raiding as war/revenge killings, widowhood, displacement, and underdevelopment.“Cattle raids bring loss of lives, instability, orphans, and a decline in productivity,” shared by one woman from Budi.They expressed a strong desire for:•  Branding cattle (chip tagging technology) by county to prevent misidentification and theft•  Deployment of police in every boma•  Ending harmful cultural norms and denouncing raiders as ""suicidal & unemployed""•  Alternative livelihoods (commercializing cattle keeping) instead of killing and stealing.•  Demand for NGOs to expand support in farming and water access.Their coping strategies included speaking to their husbands and sons, advocating peace, and community policing. One culturally significant practice mentioned was the “pronouncement of a curse” as a deterrent against raiding.   
           2.  Kraal Youths from Kapoeta and BudiThese young men, mostly aged 23–30 and with limited formal education, described their role in raiding with painful honesty. Many still saw raiding as a culturally approved symbol of strength and manhood, but their views are beginning to shift.""Keeping cattle raids will incite more violence, hatred, and intercommunal conflict. This retards our communities in terms of development.""They emphasized:•  Holding raiders accountable•  Ending the normalization of violence•  Pursuing schooling and peaceful peer influence as a way out•  Viewing raiding as a community-driven problem, not just a youth issueWhile many still perceive raiders as “brave warriors,” they increasingly understand that true strength lies in choosing peace.   
           Co-Created Pathways ForwardThe workshop produced a number of community-driven ideas with profound insights from persona reflections and empathy mapping: we jointly developed early-stage solutions that combine conventional wisdom with contemporary insight:•  Peace Kraal Networks: Cross-county grazing corridors that are jointly and community monitored.•  Initiatives for Cattle Tagging: Innovative chip technology designed to stop theft and misidentification.•  Youth Dialogues & Livelihood Labs: Encourage education, entrepreneurship, and cooperative herding.•  Community Accountability Structures: Revive and strengthen local laws and give women and elders the authority to step in early.   
           In summaryThe problem of cattle raiding in Narus and Budi won't be resolved overnight. However, the chorus of reflection, from mothers to kraal youths, indicates a change in perspective. We saw a community prepared to rethink peace from within. The residents of these counties are demonstrating that long-lasting change can start with a spark, kindled by the fireside discussions, mapping, listening, and seeing through their lens. A community that used to view raiding as honorable now talks about trauma and a new form of bravery: the ability to stop. This co-creation initiative demonstrates that significant change is achievable when solutions are sourced from within.Otherwise, we are left not only with data, insights and photographs, but with a profound respect for resilience, creativity, and wisdom rooted in South Sudan’s pastoral heartland and above all, the echo of voices like Josephine Akii, 27, from Chukudum:“When I am pregnant, I expect to give birth to a son or daughter who should not feel the impact of cattle raiding as I have.”Her vision is not just a dream. It is a future that communities across Eastern Equatoria are beginning to build—one conversation, one photo, and one promise at a time."

By Alberto Cottica and Gina Lucarelli
“It’s more complicated than that.”
For as long as we can remember, would-be reformers — including development professionals — have been struggling to anticipate the consequences of their actions. Policies that look solid on paper fail or produce unforeseen side effects. Starting in the 1980s, the science of complex adaptive systems gave us new concepts to talk about these phenomena: “rebound effects,” “feedback loops,” “tipping points,” “phase transitions,” and so on.
Understanding that systems transformation is complex is one thing. Knowing how to transform systems with reliable success is quite another. With this in mind, we at UNDP designed the plenary session on “Alternative Economic and Financial Models” at the Istanbul Innovation Days 2025 to foreground the how. We wanted to hear from people that were approaching systems transformation as practitioners and could tell us about what transforming a system looks like seen from the field. We were privileged to land on an all-stars panel. Eduard Müller explained how Costa Rica Regenerativa intervened on food systems value chains to create prosperity and regenerate the region’s biodiversity. Natalia Arjomand showed us Second Muse Capital’s novel financial instruments to channel patient finance to shared-ownership businesses. Giacomo Pinaffo gave us a taste of Fondazione Comunità Messina’s approach of endowing local communities with productive assets to enable the production of “relational goods” that encode values of solidarity and dignity. Miles Kubheka recounted Wakanda’s work to use food as a relational good to create employment and social cohesion.
The panelists’ contributions resonate with UNDP’s own work on how to bridge the gap between the theory and the practice of systems transformation. We do this work with research and development (R&D) activities, many of which live in the Accelerator Labs Network. Through our 2024 R&D Raves we surfaced and curated innovations and prototypes whose common trait was that they emerge from local communities, as they see new ways to improve their own lives and well-being. Like those in the panel, these innovations are driven by bottom-up need and ingenuity rather than top-down strategic decisions. They point to clearly defined theories of change, and to questions that those communities (and we with them) can address to consolidate their initial results and gain more options.

Learning from R&D on digital financial inclusion: how social cohesion can substitute for credit histories
Development financing is one of the three enablers of UNDP’s strategic plan 2022–2025. In 2019, UNDP established a Sustainable Finance Hub to better enable partners to accelerate financing for the Sustainable Development Goals. With 1.4 billion adults still lacking access to bank accounts, the Accelerator Labs’ work in this area has focused on financial inclusion. Just as the digital revolution is leading to financial institutions shutting down local branches and concentrating activities at headquarters, UNDP documented how proximity and community can enable inclusion.
Traditional forms of community saving are present everywhere in the world, and even the poorest have access to them, simply because their neighbors know them well enough to share a common pot of savings. R&D allows for the prototyping of digital tools to scale these initiatives and connect them with the more formal financial system. For example, somebody’s participation in a neighborhood savings group — once digitally recorded — might be accepted by a regular bank as credit history, allowing that person to open a bank account and accessing credit. Early successes in South Sudan and Zambia showed that approaches combining digital technology and proximity networks of trust between neighbors can enhance financial inclusion. The R&D Rave on digital financial inclusion identified promising ways to build on such successes. For example, we discovered low trust in digital financial services, which is likely to slow down their uptake. The Accelerator Labs are considering a global hackathon to explore new ways of creating trust between communities and service providers.
Learning from R&D on the circular economy: how waste management lays the groundwork for circularity
UNDP and its Chemicals and Waste Hub take the view that it is no longer possible to separate the ”development and growth” agenda from the “environment and climate” one. Rather, economies must be transformed to incorporate environmental agendas. UNDP’s R&D work in this area has highlighted pathways to bootstrap circular ambitions into economies at various stages of industrial development. Solid waste management is one such path. Global Majority countries are awash in single-use plastics. As they set out to modernize waste management services, they become exposed to the idea of a circular economy. Unfortunately, information about the location, composition and circular potential of waste is often incomplete.
This has prompted many Accelerator Labs to localize illegal dumpsites; analyze the composition of waste streams; assess its recycling potential; map the daily runs of informal waste collectors. Once this information is organized — often in rich, complex maps, such as this one in Panama — opportunities emerge to make those economies more circular. Additionally, extending health insurance schemes to informal waste-pickers turns out to be a way to increase volumes and quality of collected waste, as well as to protect the health of vulnerable informal workers. In Tanzania, the Lab partnered with the Taka ni Ajira Foundation on the Waste Banks initiative which collects daily waste data from pickers and creates a credit score matrix based on the data. The result was a bespoke microinsurance product for informal waste pickers.
R&D has also surfaced pathways to circularity in unexpected places, like the buildup of the industrial capacity of small businesses to close some materials loops (Mongolia), or the elevation of informal networks of waste pickers and sorters into full-fledged green businesses (Ethiopia).
Our bottom-up R&D process pointed to several promising directions for future work to make the economy more circular. For example, the Accelerator Labs are looking to systematically map indigenous practices of sustainable resource management, and to learn from them. The idea is to develop an array of culturally intuitive practices that can be integrated into modern circular systems. Another promising direction is prototyping digital tokens to enable citizens to directly invest in “their” circular infrastructure — like community composting facilities or hydroponic agriculture systems. This has the potential to create community ownership of a circular approach and share its benefits, while reducing upfront costs.
Learning from R&D on food systems: local pathways to systems change
UNDP sees food systems as deeply connected with the efforts to combat climate change, protect ecosystems and ́support livelihoods. Its Food Systems team focuses on forest positive agriculture, sustainable production landscapes and food systems transformation, via a systems thinking, multi-stakeholder approach. R&D work in this area explores roads less travelled. The Accelerator Labs support “local moonshots” for regions to become more self-sufficient when it comes to food production, in the interest of food security (Philippines): build up solar-powered processing capacity for food produce, enabling farmers to capture a higher share of its added value (Malaysia): shape consumer markets so that they will demand climate-resilient crops (Egypt); experiment with locally sourced non-chemical pesticides (Zimbabwe, Lesotho); produce and aggregate open data, and curate data collectives to support precision agriculture and investment (India).
Going forward the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network envisions activities such as integrating food waste and orphaned crops (which have an inherent local dimension) into various value-added streams like local cuisine, artisanal products, and tourism. The goal of these initiatives is to learn how to build on under-utilized, local foodstuffs and contribute to regional economies. Another highly promising direction for work is to build a knowledge- and data base of food waste, since food waste has a high potential for circularity.

Towards a manageable systems transformation through R&D
As we reflect on our R&D Raves, we find ourselves feeling more hopeful than when we started. Systems transformation is a hard task, but it need not be impossible. R&D offers a possible way forward. The UNDP Malaysia Accelerator Lab, for example, supported a marginalized community in Moyong, in the state of Sabah in 2021 when local producers lost access to the market due to COVID restrictions. The Lab responded by developing a simple e-commerce platform and supporting local businesses to learn to use it to sell their products online. Once that was up, and working well, those producers quickly realized that they were no longer limited to selling their products locally: they could ship anywhere — in theory. In practice, though, that meant getting the logistics right: long-distance shipping was quite expensive with respect to the price of the products themselves.
To address this problem, the Lab had the e-commerce platform pivot from retail to wholesale, to take advantage of economies of scale in shipping. Solving this challenge immediately created a new one: some processing was needed to lengthen the shelf-life of products, as well as increase their added value. In the case of dried fruit, one of the best-selling products, it became apparent that oven drying was too expensive and operated at an insufficient scale.
Partnering up with the government of Japan, the Lab developed an open source solar dryer, ruggedized and optimized to operate in tropical climate. At this point, the local food system had become unrecognizable: their markets, business model, processing technology and value chain had all changed. In the space of 18 months, system change had happened.
Notice how this process differs from the reductionist approach decried by economist Yuen Yuen Ang. It does not break down a large problem into independent pieces that can be tackled one micro-intervention at a time. On the contrary, systems change in practice uses system connectedness as an asset. Each intervention leads the system into the next one, always keeping the Sustainable Development Goals as their north star, always working to open more opportunities where fewer, or none, existed before.
According to French economist Thomas Piketty, bold reform needs social experimentation: start with an idea, test it in a sandbox, improve it, and iterate, until it’s ready for broader deployment. This sounds much like R&D. While scholarly debate and theoretical models are certainly valuable, systems transformation might be one of those things that are easier to do in practice than to fit into an elegant theory. For this kind of work, every experience and every partnership are precious. The R&D Raves on digital financial inclusion, the circular economy and food systems have resulted in a list of practical actions meant to kickstart system transformation. As we prepare to execute them, we are looking for partners willing to do it with us, so that we can learn together. If that sounds appealing, let’s talk.

                                           In a world grappling with economic uncertainties, global crises, and rapidly evolving technological landscapes, the need for innovative solutions to address pressing issues has never been more critical. In this context, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) with additional support from Salesianos de Dom Bosco Angola, embarked on a transformative journey aimed at bridging the digital divide and equipping young women with the skills they need to thrive in the future world of work. This blog explores the first steps of the implementation of the ""Digital Inclusion and Future Skills Education Pilot Project"" in the Municipality of Cacuaco, Angola, from November 2023 to December 2024.The Digital Divide and Future Skills GapAngola, like many other countries, faced numerous challenges exacerbated by international economic instability. A fragile economy, dependency on oil, and reduced fuel subsidies placed immense pressure on vulnerable families. Youth and women bore the brunt of these difficulties, with youth unemployment as a critical challenge. At the same time, there is a significant commitment to diversify the economy with a variety of government programs promoting industry and agriculture. Agriculture and the food value-chains are particularly at the center of all efforts as they not only contribute to food security, reducing imports and boosting local production and consumption. These sectors also encapsulate a series of business opportunities that might change the panorama of unemployment and informal employment in rural areas, which in turn would also move and turn the development wheel forward and contribute to decentralization. So here we are, we are looking at an open window of opportunity to unlock a systemic leverage that can accelerate development.As Angola's young population continues to grow, so does the demand for internet access, digital services, and digital literacy. However, internet connectivity remains limited, particularly in peri-urban and rural areas. This digital divide has resulted in unequal access to digital opportunities and literacy.Moreover, traditional education systems are struggling to keep up with the changing landscape of work. As digitalization advances, there is a growing need for new skills, mindsets, and digital literacy. Project-based and digital education is still limited for most of the population, leaving young people without access to academic training. To secure Angola's future in the global economy, it is essential to modernize the education system, create jobs, and promote economic development.

           A joint vision starts to unfold in CacuacoIn 2022, the UNDP Angola Country Office embarked on an 8-month Deep Demonstration (DD) journey in collaboration with the CHÔRA Foundation and the UNDP Strategic Innovation Unit. This journey aimed to establish new capabilities within the UNDP portfolio to support system transformation. One key area of focus within this portfolio was the Future of Work.Within the Future of Work portfolio, the ""Digital Inclusion and Future Skills Education Pilot"" emerged as a vital initiative. This pilot was designed to address the digital skills gap, especially among young women living in peri-urban and rural areas. These skills would not only open job opportunities but also strengthen self-owned businesses and ensure their sustainability.The pilot initiative was launched in the Municipality of Cacuaco, where a selected group of young people, particularly young women, were engaged in a cooperative supported by the AgriPREI Project, where they had access to training in food processing and transformation to start developing capacity to expand business opportunities.Looking at the potential of the cooperative and the youth that had been trained, UNDP came in with the project to provide access to basic digital tools and test a training package that included digital, management, marketing, and entrepreneurship skills tailored to young women in cooperatives.

           Empowering the Future WorkforceWith the support from trainers from a local CSO, Salesianos de Dom Bosco Angola, the pilot is covering the following areas:Connectivity and Digital Access: ensuring young people, especially girls in peri-urban and rural areas, have access to basic digital skills, digital business tools, and e-commerce solutions, strengthening their operations and capabilities.Future-Oriented Skills: The project is testing a compendium of practical management, business, and entrepreneurial skills co-created with the private sector. This initiative aims to increase job opportunities and skills for youth involved in agriculture-value chain businesses.The project's activities started with the establishment of a training space, equipped with basic materials to feel like a learning space. The second phase included the co-design of a comprehensive training program through community assessments and workshops including great participation from start-ups and private sector companies that have relevant work and connection with rural youth and the agri-food value-chains. At this stage, the trainers are delivering training to 20 young people, with 80% of them being women. These young participants are gaining essential digital skills, business acumen, and entrepreneurship expertise, setting them on a path towards a brighter future.Learning at the centerWe are approaching this initiative by looking at knowledge, attitudes, and practices, so we did a pre-assessment before the training and will do another one at the end. Additionally, we will also be looking at key hypothesis to test and key learning questions to explore. We will make efforts to explore insights from interviews, human interest stories and journey mapping to have a significant overlapping of information that will eventually be relevant to understand the system and the positive and negative implications of the training program. This flexible approach is enabling the project team to adapt and refine training components and methodologies according to the community's needs and feedback.Despite limited access to desktop computers or laptops, most participants possess basic cell phones and smartphones with internet access, highlighting the significance of mobile devices in their daily lives, particularly in areas where traditional computers are less common. Gender-based disparities are evident, with a notable percentage of women not using computers, while men exhibit a more varied distribution in computer usage. In mobile phone skills, women tend to have higher confidence, but both genders exhibit significant gaps in software and internet-related challenges. The gender divide is also felt in the attendance and participation in the training. Many young girls between 19 to 25 years old have month old babies that they need to bring to the class, while others are forced skip training sometimes due to childcare duties. While the pilot does not include dedicated childcare support, in future iterations this is critical to ensure equal access to training. Internet access is a crucial issue, with half of the participants relying on limited mobile data and others lacking access at home or work/school. This underscores the importance of affordable and widespread connectivity. The analysis of gender and technological skills reveals that women excel in specific areas but have fewer diverse skills compared to men. Both genders exhibit shortcomings in advanced skills, underscoring the need for accessible learning resources and support for all.The most common use of mobile phones is photography, with most participants mentioning that they take pictures every day or at least twice a week. Most participants use Facebook daily and some also use Whatsapp often, indicating that they are familiar and comfortable with communication platforms and social networks. This may reflect the importance of social communication and networking in their daily lives. However, the main reason behind the preference for Facebook is that it is currently free to use in the country not requiring data. However, tools like Microsoft Word and Excel are less frequently used, suggesting a need to enhance digital literacy and productivity software skills, especially in agriculture-related businesses.This analysis underscores the importance of inclusive training and digital inclusion programs to bridge skill gaps and empower individuals to effectively use technology and digital tools across various contexts. While participants have basic skills in common communication and social networking apps, they lack knowledge and usage of productivity and design tools. There's a recognition of technology's potential for personal and professional improvement, coupled with a willingness to learn. Therefore, hands-on training and educational programs focusing on these areas and fostering continuous learning might enhance participants' overall digital competency.

           Walking the talkThe delivery of the training is on track, we are currently covering the digital literacy and capabilities module looking at key software’s and applications. We still have very interesting chapters ahead, including marketing, e-commerce, communication, and a final hands-on module focused on entrepreneurship featuring group work activities and business model ideation. For these final modules we will experiment with masterclasses from private sector partners who will share their experiences with the group. We are not necessarily expecting to arrive at viable business models to accelerate, but overall, we are hoping for a learning by doing approach that can enable the participants to gain the skills and be ready and empowered to venture into new types of businesses, when the opportunity comes.The ""Digital Inclusion and Future Skills Education Pilot"" in Cacuaco, Angola, builds on the power of collaboration, innovation, and determination. By addressing the digital divide and equipping young women with essential skills, this project has laid the foundation for a more prosperous and inclusive future. As Angola continues to navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing world, initiatives like these will be instrumental in shaping a resilient and empowered workforce ready to embrace the opportunities of tomorrow."

                                           What are the implications of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) for the Caribbean's creative sector? And how are creatives, policymakers and others preparing for this shift?These were key questions raised at the A.I. Symposium on Caribbean Arts & Heritage, recently hosted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Accelerator Lab for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, the Barbados Museum & Historical Society (BMHS) and the International Council of Museums (ICOM). Guided by the International Museum Day 2025 theme of “The Future of Museums in Rapidly Changing Communities"", the A.I. Symposium featured dynamic panels of experts in policy, copyright law, Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), film and television, arts education, human rights, archaeology and more - all gathered to discuss how A.I. is disrupting the arts sector by highlighting both sides of the coin through engaging public dialogue.   
                   
            
    



           Guests gather at the A.I. Symposium on Caribbean Arts & Heritage.     UNDP/Anton Nixon     
            Through six thematic panels, the A.I. Symposium on Caribbean Arts & Heritage explored how the region’s creative sector is intersecting with A.I., a subject that is shaping discussions among school boards, production crews, libraries and artists alike. The live conversations with subject matter experts revealed a complex environment with challenges and opportunities ahead, many of which clustered around the following key themes that emerged for consideration:   
                                
            
        
                  
              
              
              
              
                  

  
        
  

           
            
        
                  
              
              
              
              
                  

  
        
  

         
            The Double-Edged Sword of A.I.Several panelists noted the many benefits that A.I. can bring to the Orange Economy in the Caribbean, including democratizing access to cultural heritage, enhancing arts education capacities and opening new markets for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Many of these positive shifts are already being seen, even if on a small scale. On the flipside, numerous risks were noted - with the potential for A.I. to exacerbate inequalities, further entrench biases, and threaten cultural diversity. From a security standpoint, ethical concerns around data use, privacy, and intellectual property were frequently raised. This resulted in a double-edged sword dynamic requiring proper stewardship to ensure the safe usage of A.I. for creative purposes.  2. Ethics, Equity and Human RightsMany emphasized that any application of A.I. in the arts sector should be firmly rooted in an ethical framework based on human dignity, cultural specificity, and inclusivity. This included calls for a transparent, fair and rights-based approach to A.I. regulation. Additionally, given that A.I. tools are often consumed rather than produced in the Caribbean, it was recognized that A.I. must be anchored in local values rather than those imported externally from global tech hubs. This reflects the reality that dominant A.I. systems typically include Western biases and exclude Caribbean perspectives. As such, there is a need to train A.I. on regional data while also making efforts to protect that data from misuse.  
                 
            
    



        
            3. Governance Gaps and the Demand for Regional StrategyIn Barbados and among the wider Caribbean, A.I. policies are under development, especially when it comes to the creative industries where issues such as deepfakes, voice cloning and unauthorized use of likenesses are prevalent. In this process, there is the distinct challenge of keeping up with the fast speed of A.I. technologies, which are constantly evolving. To address this nascent governance field, regional collaboration was recommended with emphasis on solutions co-designed with grassroots communities, artists, technologists and policymakers alongside institutions such as UNDP, BMHS and ICOM as key partners. This Caribbean-wide approach could together address A.I. policy, digital infrastructure and cultural preservation.  
                 
            
    



        
            4. A.I. and the Orange EconomyThe Orange Economy, encompassing economic activities derived from creativity, culture and innovation, is home to specific complexities when it comes to A.I., such as the requirement for protection of intellectual property in music, film, and literature. Several artists underscored the importance of understanding digital ownership, authorship and authentication in the age of A.I., resulting in a strong demand for digital rights and policies that prioritize creators. Additionally, fair compensation for creatives was mentioned and tied to the devaluation of art forms that could occur through A.I., as well as the risks of job displacement posed by emerging tools in graphic design, sound production and editing.  
                 
            
    



        
            5. Education and Digital Capacity Building  The Government of Barbados is integrating digital capacity-building efforts into the classroom, seen in coding, digital literacy and civics in the curriculum. These efforts are ultimately preparing students for a future deeply impacted by A.I. At the same time, arts education is focusing on critical thinking, responsible technology use and empowering youth to be active creators rather than passive consumers. This also connects to instilling a sense of integrity and ownership among art producers in the A.I. landscape.  
                 
            
    



        
            6. A.I. and Heritage PreservationGlobally in the heritage field, A.I. is being used to digitize heritage-based archives, enhance metadata creation and support conservation. The digitization of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), which includes language, rituals, crafts and oral traditions, is a bit more complex, however, as these elements are harder to digitize and protect. Panelists found that A.I. can help document ICH, but that the fundamentals of trust, consent and cultural sensitivity must be established first. To best future-proof these efforts, the significance of open-source tools, distributed storage and non-proprietary formats for sustainability purposes were voiced.  
                 
            
    



        
            7. Gender, LGBTQIA+ Rights & Digital Safety  Depending on its use, A.I. can amplify marginalized voices or reinforce systemic biases, thus necessitating a stringent approach to regulation and oversight. Concerns around automated harassment, surveillance, and data exploitation were raised. To mitigate these potential pitfalls, panelists recommended intersectionality, community-led safeguards and inclusive data practices in A.I. 8. A.I. in Archaeology & Heritage PreservationIn archaeology, history is meeting modern technology through applications of A.I. to geophysical surveys, predictive modeling and 3D reconstructions of archaeological sites. This presents valuable inroads to repatriation, education, and cultural storytelling. Still, worries about data ownership, community consent and digital colonialism were expressed as worthy of greater attention and investigation.  
                 
            
    



        
            9. Call to Action: Local Innovation & Collaboration  Resoundingly heard throughout the panels was a call for the Caribbean to get involved in developing its own A.I. tools while training local talent and shaping global technology narratives. To do so, a push was made for collaboration across sectors, merging government, academia, civil society and creatives together. Overall, A.I. was deemed a transformative opportunity if approached with care, equity, and strategic vision.To watch the A.I.

                                           In the heart of Upper Egypt, where ancient heritage meets untapped rural potential, a quiet revolution is underway. The UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab, in partnership with the Knowledge Economy Foundation (KEF), is spearheading a bold initiative to reimagine tourism—not as a fleeting experience, but as a sustainable engine for socio-economic resilience. Through innovative agrotourism models in Luxor and Aswan, this collaboration is redefining how rural communities engage with tourism, heritage, and development.From Antiquities to Authenticity: A New Tourism ParadigmEgypt’s tourism sector has long been synonymous with its iconic antiquities. But today’s travelers seek more than monuments—they crave immersive, authentic experiences. Recognizing this shift, the UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab has embraced a forward-thinking approach: agrotourism as a catalyst for inclusive growth.Agrotourism blends agriculture, culture, and hospitality, offering visitors a chance to experience rural life firsthand—whether through harvesting sugarcane, learning traditional cooking, or staying in eco-lodges built by local communities. This model not only diversifies Egypt’s tourism offerings but also empowers rural populations, especially women and youth, to become active agents in their own development.The Power of Partnership: UNDP and KEFAt the core of this transformation is a dynamic partnership between the UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab and KEF. Together, they have convened multi-stakeholder roundtables in Luxor and Aswan, bringing together 60+ government officials, entrepreneurs, universities, and civil society to co-design sustainable tourism solutions.These roundtables have laid the groundwork for a portfolio approach to rural tourism—one that integrates infrastructure, licensing, digital innovation, and community training. The result is a holistic ecosystem where local voices shape the tourism narrative, and where development is rooted in local identity and assets.  
                   
            
    



           Agrotourism in Egypt includes events like tomato drying festivals which celebrate rural life and can generate income.     Adobe Stock     
           Agrotourism in Action: From Vision to ImplementationThe Accelerator Lab’s methodology, in partnership with KEF, —centered on systems thinking and frontier experimentation—has been instrumental in identifying agrotourism opportunities. Key initiatives include:Mapping Hidden Gems: Aswan University’s Faculty of Engineering is mapping lesser-known cultural and natural sites, from birdwatching trails to heritage villages. These locations are being integrated into digital platforms with QR code storytelling, enhancing visibility and accessibility. This aligns with Egypt’s broader push for cultural tourism, which contributed significantly to the 17 million international visitors in 2024. Such initiatives are part of a global trend: the number of ecotourism destinations has increased by about 8% annually over the past decade. These efforts help reduce over-tourism in popular areas and redirect visitors to lesser known, culturally rich sites.Community-Based Eco-Lodges: Projects like ECO Nubia and Gamandy Eco-Lodge exemplify how local communities can lead sustainable tourism. Built with local materials and managed by residents, these lodges offer authentic experiences while preserving environmental and cultural integrity. In 2024, Egypt saw a rise in eco-conscious travel, with many Red Sea and Upper Egypt accommodations adopting sustainable practices. Globally, 70% of ecotourists prefer to stay in eco-lodges, eco-resorts, or community-owned accommodations. In Africa, ecotourism contributes approximately 7% of the continent’s GDP, supporting millions of local jobs. These figures underscore the economic and social value of projects like ECO Nubia and Gamandy Eco-LodgeAgri-Festivals and Seasonal Tourism: Seasonal events—like tomato drying festivals and sugarcane harvest tours—can celebrate rural life and generate income. These festivals are designed to attract both domestic and international tourists, extending their stay and deepening their engagement. With tourism contributing over $31 billion to Egypt’s GDP in 2023, such niche experiences are increasingly vital for diversifying the tourism economy. Ecotourism trips generate higher economic value, with the average expenditure per trip around $1,200, compared to traditional tourism. Seasonal and agricultural festivals can tap into this premium market, offering immersive experiences that attract longer stays and deeper engagement.Training Rural Hosts: Hospitality and storytelling training programs are equipping farmers, artisans, and home-based entrepreneurs with the skills to welcome guests, share their heritage, and deliver high-quality experiences. This is crucial in a sector that employed nearly 2.5 million people in Egypt in 2023, highlighting the importance of inclusive growth in rural areas. Community involvement is key: 90% of ecotourism operators agree that local participation is crucial for success. Training programs that empower farmers, artisans, and entrepreneurs directly contribute to this model, helping diversify income and reduce dependency on traditional agriculture  
           Breaking Barriers: Licensing, Infrastructure, and InclusionOne of the Lab’s key insights is that innovation must be accompanied by policy and regulatory reform. Many rural tourism providers operate informally, facing barriers to licensing, financing, and market access. Insights suggest that local authorities and ministries need to work together to simplify licensing procedures, improve rural infrastructure, and formalize informal actors—ensuring that the benefits of tourism are equitably distributed.Moreover, the Lab is championing inclusive development. Women-led initiatives like the Nubian House and Nawaya Egypt’s community kitchens are not only preserving food heritage but also creating dignified livelihoods. Youth are being trained by KEF’s project as digital storytellers, guides, and entrepreneurs, turning their creativity into economic opportunity.Digital Transformation: Storytelling Meets TechnologyInsights recommend digital innovation as a cornerstone in the strategy. From QR code-enabled storytelling to virtual tourism platforms, technology is being harnessed by women & youth entrepreneurs to amplify local narratives and connect rural experiences with global audiences. Development of a digital infrastructure hub—a one-stop platform for training, licensing, marketing, and booking across all tourism value chains, is a key requirement.Toward a Sustainable FutureThe impact of these efforts is already visible. Communities once on the margins of Egypt’s tourism map are now emerging as vibrant destinations. Tourists are discovering the warmth of rural hospitality, the richness of local cuisine, and the beauty of Egypt’s living heritage. And most importantly, rural Egyptians are reclaiming their role as custodians of culture and stewards of sustainable development.But this is just the beginning. The UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab and KEF are committed to scaling these models, deepening partnerships, and embedding sustainability at every level. With continued support from government, academia, and the private sector, agrotourism in Upper Egypt can become a global model for inclusive, experience-driven tourism.A New Narrative for EgyptIn a world where tourism is increasingly about connection, meaning, and impact, Egypt has a unique story to tell. Through the pioneering work of the UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab and its partners, that story is being rewritten—one village, one experience, one entrepreneur at a time.Upper Egypt is no longer just a destination for ancient wonders. It is a living, breathing landscape of innovation, resilience, and hope."

                                           Worldwide, institutions face challenges such as climate crises, geopolitical shifts, societal polarization, and accelerating technological change. These disruptions demand bold, practical efforts to reimagine how institutions can remain effective, inclusive, and resilient.While incremental adjustments sufficed in stable times, today's complexity demands institutional evolution. This isn't about starting from scratch, but building on what works, shedding what doesn't, and embracing new possibilities. Current approaches are often insufficient for today's challenges, failing to recognize necessary transformations.This calls for rethinking core purposes, structures, and operations. Institutions should become more participatory, integrating diverse perspectives and equitably distributing decision-making. They need to adopt regenerative principles that restore environmental and social systems, and develop resilience to withstand shocks, adapt, and transform. This institutional evolution requires bold leadership, systems thinking, and the courage to adapt established models for a sustainable and equitable future.The 2025 Istanbul Innovation Days (IID2025) (link is external)explored this urgent need. Here, we highlight three key concepts for innovation in development:Irreversibility as a Design Principle: Embedding change for lasting impact.Regenerative Thinking in Institutional Design: Moving beyond sustainability to actively heal and renew.Data, Trust, and Relational Governance: Rebuilding legitimacy through care and accountability.Irreversibility as a Design PrincipleA standout IID2025 workshop, led by Giulio Quaggiotto and Kautsar Anggakara, focused on designing for irreversibility using the Irreversibility Framework(link is external). This structured approach to transformational organisational change guides changemakers in rooting enduring impact beyond short-term successes. Designed to help navigate political and leadership changes and resource fluctuations, the framework outlines irreversibility not as rigid permanence but as a system's capacity to maintain its transformative purpose by continually finding new pathways. The focus is on designing initiatives that are resilient and adaptable over time, embedding lasting value within the system itself rather than preserving a specific project.  
                   
            
    



           IID 2025 Workshop: Should public innovation aim to be irreversible?      Photo credit: IID2025     
           This framework addresses four interconnected areas:Value Creation: What lasting value are we creating, and how do we ensure it lasts?Value Delivery: How do we deliver this value effectively and adaptively?Foundational Support: What foundational support is needed to sustain this value over time?Feedback Loops & Metrics: How do we measure progress toward the shared intent?Adopting this framework shifts the focus from starting new projects to growing and supporting initiatives that are built to last and adapt over time. It's an ongoing process of strategic reflection, assessing value, delivery, support, and feedback to build resilience. It's a commitment to collective learning, ensuring transformative efforts endure. This framework is particularly useful for policy teams, public sector innovators, and development practitioners aiming to embed resilience in their work.Regenerative Thinking in Institutional DesignProf Eduard Müller, founder of Regenerate Costa Rica, encouraged us to move beyond just reducing harm, toward economic models that help restore people and the planet. Referring to Buckminster Fuller, he said: “Don’t fight the system. Build a better one that works.” Regenerative non-extractive economic models focus on giving back more than we take - from nature, communities, and future generations. Unlike traditional models that often exploit resources, regenerative models aim to rebuild ecosystems, strengthen local economies, and support long-term well-being. Müller’s principles for regenerative institutional thinking include:Design for Restoration: Restore ecosystems and social cohesion through policies and institutions.Embrace Systemic Thinking: Adopt a holistic perspective, mirroring living systems for integrated solutions.Cultivate the Capacity to Unlearn: Critically examine and discard practices that no longer serve social and ecological well-being. As Müller noted, “We don’t need to teach people more – we need to help them unlearn what no longer serves.”He provided examples from his work in regenerative cattle funding, municipal tax collection, and regenerative tourism. This shift from sustainability to regeneration signifies deep institutional change. Enduring institutions continuously renew, restore the commons, and prioritize future generations. Müller concluded that nature should be our inspiration for innovation.Data, Trust, and Relational GovernanceIn another powerful session, Kirikowhai Mikaere from Aotearoa New Zealand National Iwi (Tribal) Chairs Forum reminded us that “trust is the currency of data.” As Lead Technical Advisor for the National Iwi Chairs Forum on Māori Data Governance, she challenged the framing of data as a neutral, extractable asset.The Te Kāhui Raraunga Māori Data Governance Model(link is external) asserts Māori authority over Māori data as a taonga (treasure), enabling self-determination and collective wellbeing. Centered on the principle “Data for self-determination,” it offers a values-based approach for public service agencies to govern Māori data ethically and align with Māori priorities. It outlines eight key Data Pou (pillars) covering areas like data protection, access, infrastructure, and workforce development, grounded in principles like accountability, decolonisation, and nurturing data as a sacred resource. The model calls for shared governance, legislative change, and strategic investment to enable genuine partnership and transform Aotearoa’s data ecosystem.Mikaere urged seeing data as a relationship shaped by care, context, and accountability. She highlighted cultural worldviews in governance, with Māori data governance grounded in principles(link is external) such as:Rangatiratanga (autonomy, sovereignty, self-determination or customary leadership)Manaakitanga (ethics of care, respect and inclusive responsibility)Kaitiakitanga (trust, stewardship and guardianship of data for future generations)She stressed that trust must be earned through courageous leadership. ""Trust is the currency of data,"" she reiterated. ""We call our leaders Rangatira, those who can weave the people together. And in an insecure and complex world, we need courage, especially the courage to share power."" Institutions endure not from size, but from trust, care, and collaborative governance.A Shared Horizon: Designing Institutions That EndureIID2025 presented a new vision for public institutions. Themes like irreversibility, relational governance, and regenerative thinking emphasized that enduring institutions require a fundamental shift: designing for lasting relevance, genuine connection and trust, and actively contributing to people and the planet's well-being.Cross-cutting themes deepened this horizon. Sessions on decision-making under uncertainty highlighted human cognition's role. We explored innovative governance roles like Chief Time Officers and Ministries of Loneliness. Conversations on informality and culture underscored that institutions run on relationships as much as rules. Bold provocations included multi-species collaboration, nature-informed intelligence, and strategic development intelligence.ID2025's insights emphasize that creating enduring institutions means evolving how we think, build, and relate. It's about embracing innovative designs that are irreversible in impact, trustworthy in operations, and regenerative in essence. This is the shared horizon: building institutions that thrive and foster a more resilient and equitable future.These ideas offer UNDP Accelerator Labs and Country Offices tangible lenses for navigating complexity. We see potential to apply them in public sector innovation, citizen engagement, and future-skilling. The challenge now is to adopt, localize, and irreversibly embed these concepts within our systems.For further exploration:Institutional Innovation Playbook(link is external)A New Architecture for Public Institutions – UNDP Feature(link is external)IID2025 Conference Recordings(link is external)Let’s keep the conversation going."
18190,"","What do we learn when we listen to the Global Majority on AI?UNDP Accelerator Labs7 min read·Jun 17, 2025--ListenSharePerspectives on AI Gathered Through Participatory Practices in 16 Global Majority CountriesBy Jeremy Boy, with inputs from Mirko Ebelshaeuser and Drasko Draskovic.The 2025 UNDP Human Development Report posits that making Artificial Intelligence (AI) a driver of human development is a matter of choice. The question is, who gets a say in making these choices?For the past five years, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network has been actively engaged in participatory data innovation and AI action research throughout Global Majority countries, whether it be through collective intelligence design; through national consultations and dialogues on AI with a wide variety of stakeholders, ranging from government to civil society; or through the use of generative AI to facilitate participatory processes.Following work we did last year with Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) graduate students to design a framework for conducting national dialogues on frontier technologies, we teamed up with our colleagues in UNDP’s Human Development Report Office to consult with and learn from Labs in 16 countries what they had picked up through their work on people’s perceptions of AI. All had concrete, practical experience of engaging with national stakeholders on the topic of AI, whether from government, private sector or civil society.Awareness of AI is growing, but deliberate use and understanding often remains limitedAll Labs reported a general awareness of AI from the many people they interacted with through their work — whether it be through reference to popular applications like ChatGPT, in terms of strategic business or institutional priorities, or simply as a concept. However, many also pointed out a limited depth of technical understanding, of knowledge of when AI was embedded in commonly used systems or applications, or of the concrete possibilities offered by AI. Some issues raised included low digital literacy and a perception that AI was a “black box”. Additionally, Labs sometimes had to mitigate unrealistic expectations that AI could be applied to almost anything.Most Labs further reported that people, from TikTok content creators in Bangladesh to rural communities in Trinidad and Tobago, generally had mixed feelings about the deployment of AI, with perceptions varying from techno-optimism to considerable skepticism. The Lab in Belarus highlighted a general positivity towards AI, with almost 50% of respondents to a nation-wide survey they conducted reaching 11K people affirming they trusted AI — albeit in most cases, on the condition that they understood how the algorithms worked. The Lab in Trinidad and Tobago mentioned that cautious optimism was often met with healthy skepticism, with 62% of respondents to a survey they conducted in six different locations around the country reaching 211 people mentioning mixed feelings about AI, and a clear divide on whether to trust AI to make decisions that could affect human lives (46% trust versus 42% distrust). Finally, speaking specifically about small shop owners, the Lab in Ecuador stated that people perceived AI as somewhat irrelevant in their day-to-day lives.This is in part due to the challenge of discussing AI as a monolithic technology: it can lead to misrepresentations, unrealistic expectations, and misplaced trust or distrust. There is a dire need for clarity about the possibilities that AI systems can offer, as well as their limitations, in different contexts and for different populations, sectors, and institutions. Conversations about AI need to be situated and based on concrete examples that resonate with people’s experiences.AI-powered drones are being tested by UNDP Zimbabwe’s Accelerator Lab to drive quelea birds into farmer’s nets. The quelea bird decimates farmers’ crops and affects their livelihoods. Photo: UNDP Accelerator LabsIt is not just a matter of AI literacyOne way to anchor conversations about AI is to pay attention to the specific applications or use cases people refer to, and to use these as proxies for the broader socio-technical system. This can lead to insightful conversations about the perceived or anticipated implications of such applications. For example, the Lab in the Ukraine, reporting numbers from the Ministry of Digital Transformation’s White Paper on AI Regulation in the Ukraine, mentioned that 57% of the population were familiar with chatbots; the Lab in Paraguay claimed that civil society often associated AI with targeted ads; and the Lab in Bosnia and Herzegovina evoked some level of public awareness of more specialized applications like AI-assisted radiology and automated customer service. Conversely, the Lab in Guinea stated that individuals with limited digital literacy tended to refer to interacting with AI assistants as “talking to robots,” revealing a fear of not knowing who might be controlling them. Many Labs also reported that people were concerned about AI-facilitated deepfakes and information integrity, data privacy and job replacements or displacements.This suggests that increasing people’s agency over AI is not just a matter of literacy. It is also a matter of demystifying how we collectively refer to and engage with the socio-technical system. This can enable people to seize opportunities, as well as engage in matters of concern and advocate for desirable technological futures.There is not one AI divide, but a multitude of intersecting AI dividesThe Labs highlighted important variations in awareness and understanding of AI, as well as inequities in access and opportunity, within countries and across socio-economic groups. These include geographic divides, for example, between rural and urban areas; generational divides, with younger populations often appearing to be more informed and optimistic about AI; and gender divides, with women expressing less positivity about AI than men, as well as greater concerns about the potential misuse of their images to generate deepfakes.Just as it is problematic to discuss AI in monolithic terms, it is unrealistic to expect that it will uniformly permeate and impact different economies, societies and demographics around the world. It is important to critically assess where AI can truly make a positive impact on development, and for whom. Frontier technologies like AI need to be considered from national, and even local perspectives, not just from a global one.In Sylhet, Bangladesh, young social media users (18–29 years) share their hopes, doubts, and expectations around trust, agency, and participation in AI in a focused group discussion. Photo: UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab/Iffat AnjumIncentives behind the development and deployment of AI need to be addressedThe private sector is moving faster than the public sector’s ability to adopt or regulate AI, as many Labs confirmed. Several Labs also discussed infrastructural issues, as well as perceptions of colonial legacy, foreign influence and new dependencies. Others provided a reality check, suggesting that widespread adoption of AI was a distant mirage given the current digital landscape in their countries.For example, the Lab in Panama mentioned that academics thought most about the use of AI for productivity gains in the private sector, as opposed to its deployment in public services; the Labs in Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia noted that data and AI governance was a work in progress in their countries, and that regulations were taking time to be established. The Lab in North Macedonia further pointed out that discussions about AI were mainly driven by business, not by the government or civil society. The Lab in Colombia also shared the view that private companies were shaping the narrative and highlighted that while the country had an Ethical Framework for AI (Marco Ético para la IA), there was a lack of mechanisms for verifying and enforcing compliance. The Lab in Ecuador further pondered how balancing sustainability with digital growth was a major challenge in the country.These international dynamics between private and public sectors raise important questions about balancing economic incentives — predominantly those of large, Global North conglomerates — and the global public good. There is a need to guarantee that the advantages of AI are distributed equitably, ensuring that those who contribute much of the primary resources such as data also benefit from the economic returns.Towards being more democratic about technologyBuilding trust and enabling greater agency over AI are critical endeavors. As UNDP actively works on re-imagining trust and safety for AI, we remain committed to including a plurality of voices from the Global Majority, as indeed, our collective technological futures should be a matter of choice. To this end, discrete consultations and engagements are necessary, but not enough. They need to be multiplied across all regions of the globe, even in places that may not be particularly AI ready and should be committed to “participation as justice,” i.e., a more continuous, long-term form of engagement that is based on mutual benefits, reciprocity, equity and justice. We encourage you to check out our framework for conducting national dialogues on frontier technologies, and to use it to foster more participation at your level, wherever you are.In doing so, we hope to move away from the paradigm of “democratizing technology” to one of being more democratic about technology.Full list of Labs represented: Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Argentina, Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Trinidad and Tobago, Guinea, Kenya, Morocco, Bangladesh.Methodological note: It is important to note that the insights reported in this blogpost are derived from subjective observations that are based on experience. They should be considered as signals rather than representative views held in any given country. Our goal in sharing these insights is to contribute to a plurality of perspectives on AI that, importantly, come from places that are generally far from the centers of research, development, and funding of AI.Acknowledgements: we would like to acknowledge the insightful contributions from everyone in the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network who took part in this work, as well as our colleagues in the Human Development Report Office with whom we led the learning circle discussed in this post: Josefin Pasanen, Prachi Paliwal, and Antonio Gonzalez."

                         The challenges and benefits(link is external) of urbanization are well known. One may experience the city from a place of privilege and enjoyment of its amenities, or from a place of deprivation and survival. Yet regardless of social class, local governments' basic responsibilities are a) to ensure all residents can access city amenities and services efficiently and affordably, b) that those services are citizen-centered, and c) that their voices are heard and included in local decision-making processes.

One of the most critical issues faced by cities in the developing world is that, as urban sprawl consolidates(link is external), there are persistent local governance issues predominantly in socioeconomically deprived zones. A case in point, in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), there is greater public demand for citizens’ participation in policy decision-making in tandem with a steady decline in public trust in governments throughout the region(link is external), due in part to a collective discontent generated by low participation.

Good governance is fundamental (link is external)for a healthy democracy. Although its meaning and scope are debated and contested(link is external), as a working definition, I conceive of governance as the space of shared power and negotiation between institutions of government and the governed, in pursuit of the collective good. More specifically, for UNDP ""local governance comprises the set of institutions, mechanisms and processes through which citizens and their groups can articulate their interests and needs, mediate their differences and exercise their rights and obligations at the local level.""

Community governance and the politics of local leadership

Social inequality and weak participatory mechanisms is at the heart of dysfunctional local governance. Most often, a society's lowest strata possess the least bargaining power in making their voices heard. Indeed, UNDP has paid considerable attention to urbanization and inequality, arguing in a report that ""pro-poor urban governance"" is a critical requisite for cities and communities to be livable. For instance, research (link is external)shows that it is among the most economically deprived urban areas where violence and social dysfunction are most salient.

Good governance can nourish a space for local civic engagement that results in positive change(link is external). Yet, social conflict and the struggle for limited resources can jeopardize a community's attempt to find common ground and compromise. In that sense, our ethnographic work in Santo Domingo has been enlightening on the complexities of local governance. While formal governance instruments exist (e.g., neighborhood associations, grassroots organizations, meetings with municipal authorities), community leaders and organizers often complain that their voices go unheard, government commitments unfulfilled, and inner political struggles among local leadership preclude communities from showing a united front on important issues.

In addition, the absence of sound institutional rule enforcement in slum neighborhoods(link is external) weakens the space of governance. Surely, cohesion and peaceful social interactions might be difficult when poverty, the lack of urban planning, overcrowding, and precariousness are some of the salient traits of community life. When conflict arises, even physical violence, it undermines community integration and disperses the social capital available. Social disorganization(link is external) weakens the bonds of solidarity and cohesion. As A. Portes(link is external) contends, the particular social ecosystems of slum neighborhoods are perfectly rational for people who live in marginality.

Our argument here is that sociocultural arrangements and the psychosocial/behavioral repertoire of practices among community leaders and stakeholders influence governance and the ways a community's sociopolitical ecosystem is reproduced. Individuals tend to act according to what the resources and institutional practices permit them. Nonetheless, in our experience, plenty of slum community members(link is external) and leaders work tirelessly and generously for the greater good. Yet their efforts are often jeopardized by the limited social capital and the weak ties of the governance space in their communities.


Addressing local governance problems as development practitioners

Although, as AccLab, our problem space is solid waste management (SWM)(link is external), our observations transcend SWM and touch on a wide range of pivotal issues for human development. Local governance is one of those learning experiences worth reporting about. I believe there are steps one can take to ensure that projects remain feasible while articulating a more cohesive local governance space:


	Participatory decision-making cannot be an empty, meaningless governance exercise. Many leaders feel used as PR instruments while solutions often remain on paper and rarely implemented. Ensuring they are seen and heard is critical. As a local leader once told me: ""I like working with you (UNDP) because you have been the only institution that takes us seriously in what we say.""
	Establish neutrality and seriousness of purpose from the outset. Marginalized communities are used to seeing development projects as political mechanisms that generate support in local or national elections. Being perceived as working for one or the other side might slow or put implementation at risk. Further, finding leadership that puts political affiliation aside is necessary for true progress.
	Articulating local governance is a humbling experience for our often stratification-informed perceptions of knowledge and whose opinion matters. As an international development agency whose name carries a certain weight, textbook expertise does not fully prepare us to understand the social world of people at the margins and the subjectivities of their everyday lives.
	Governance is an iterative process. Learning, listening, and understanding diverse (and often contrasting) perspectives among community members means that an idea for a solution is never fixed, even if it was successful. One must learn to negotiate and choose between what is ideal and what is possible.



L. Romeo has aptly cautioned that ""local development is not just development that happens locally... but rather development that leverages the comparative and competitive advantages of localities and mobilizes their specific physical, economic, cultural, social and political resources.""(link is external) I will argue that good governance and high stocks of social capital are inseparable for local development to impact people's well-being positively. Together, the two can catalyze action, make interventions more sustainable, furnish a space for learning from one another, and broker solutions that can agglutinate support from diverse local stakeholders."

	Monsieur le Président, Excellences, Mesdames et Messieurs les Membres du Conseil d’administration Mesdames et Messieurs les Membres des délégations siégeant en qualité d’observateurs, Chers collègues, J’ai l’immense plaisir de vous retrouver ce jour à l’occasion de la première session ordinaire du Conseil d’administration du PNUD, du FNUAP et de l’UNOPS pour l’année 2023. Permettez-moi de commencer par vous féliciter, Excellence Monsieur. Martin Kimani, Représentant permanent de la République du Kenya, pour votre élection à la présidence du Conseil d’administration du PNUD, du FNUAP et de l’UNOPS. Permettez-moi également d’exprimer mes félicitations aux vice-présidents du Conseil et aux membres du Bureau pour 2023, à savoir les ambassadeurs Muhith du Bangladesh, Chan du Costa Rica, Kyslytsya de l’Ukraine et Sinirlioğlu de la Türkiye. Nous nous réjouissons à la perspective de travailler en étroite collaboration avec vous durant cette année.
	Je tiens également à exprimer ma gratitude aux membres sortants du Bureau, à savoir les ambassadeurs Al-Thani du Qatar, Rodriguez Cuadros du Pérou et le Président sortant, l’ambassadeur Brandt du Royaume des Pays-Bas, pour leur leadership et leurs conseils en 2022.
	Je suis également très heureux de souhaiter la bienvenue à leur première réunion du Conseil d’administration à deux nouveaux membres de mon équipe de direction, à savoir : Ivana Zivkovic, directrice du Bureau régional pour l’Europe et la Communauté des États indépendants, et Michelle Muschett, directrice du Bureau régional pour l’Amérique latine et les Caraïbes. Je suis aussi heureux du fait que notre nouvelle directrice du Bureau des Nations Unies pour la coopération Sud-Sud (UNOSSC), Dima Al-Khatib, prendra prochainement ses nouvelles fonctions. Je profite par ailleurs de cette occasion pour remercier Khalida Bouzar, directrice du Bureau régional pour les États arabes, qui nous quittera bientôt, pour son soutien et son engagement indéfectibles durant son mandat au PNUD. J’aimerais également saisir cette occasion pour remercier Svetlana Iazykova, qui a été l’épine dorsale du secrétariat du Conseil d’administration depuis 28 ans et qui prend une retraite bien méritée !
	Je nous souhaite à tous une bonne année, surtout au regard de l’année que nous venons de traverser. Lorsque j’ai pris la parole à cette session du Conseil au début de 2022, nous pensions que le relèvement à la suite de la COVID-19 et de ses conséquences sociales et économiques avait commencé. Les vaccins nous donnaient des raisons d’espérer et de croire que le pire était peut-être derrière nous. Tout au long de la pandémie, le PNUD s’est mobilisé et a joué un rôle essentiel dans les efforts mondiaux de grande envergure qui ont permis de soutenir les systèmes de santé, d’élargir la couverture des dispositifs de protection sociale et de protéger des emplois.
	Cette période semble maintenant être le premier chapitre des crises que nous connaissons aujourd’hui. Le relèvement et le moment où il s’achèvera sont incertains dans un contexte marqué par un cumul de guerre, de tensions politiques mondiales, d’explosion du coût de la vie, de famine, de crise de la dette, de catastrophes climatiques et de recul des progrès dans la réalisation des Objectifs de développement durable (ODD). Le Rapport sur le développement humain 2022 du PNUD décrit avec justesse un ensemble d’incertitudes, où de multiples tensions se renforcent mutuellement et compromettent le développement.
	Depuis plus de trois décennies déjà, le PNUD calcule l’indice de développement humain. C’était la première fois qu’il déclinait dans le monde pendant deux années consécutives. Nous avons été ramenés à 2016, lorsque nous avons commencé à mettre en œuvre les ODD. Personne n’a été épargné. Quatre-vingt-dix des pays ont vu cet indice baisser, une proportion impressionnante. Tous les pays sont confrontés aux incertitudes de l’économie et à l’inquiétude et l’insécurité généralisées. Et nous ne sommes pas au bout de nos peines.
	En dépit de ces obstacles – de leur fait en réalité, devrais-je dire – le PNUD n’a jamais marqué de pause. Partout dans le monde, nos équipes se mobilisent aux côtés des pays en développement partenaires pour aider à endiguer l’évolution de la pauvreté et continuer de faire avancer le développement. En conséquence, des millions de personnes ont obtenu un emploi, gagné accès à des services essentiels et retrouvé sécurité, dignité et espoir.
	Je vous invite à garder à l’esprit ces points positifs, car toute nouvelle année offre un moment de renouveau, même en ces temps difficiles. C’est ainsi que j’ai le privilège de vous rendre compte aujourd’hui des progrès accomplis par le PNUD après une année de mise en œuvre de notre tout dernier Plan stratégique. Aujourd’hui, le PNUD travaille dans le cadre de partenariats étroits, à la faveur de l’approfondissement de la collaboration avec les institutions spécialisées du système des Nations Unies et divers acteurs du développement, publics et privés. Nous apportons des réponses à un large éventail de besoins des pays, en conjuguant travail intellectuel, expérience pratique et souplesse opérationnelle accrue pour relever des défis complexes à grande échelle. Et nous sommes prêts pour l’avenir, après avoir investi dans les capacités pour le développement de la nouvelle génération, allant des énergies vertes aux services numériques.
	
	Au PNUD, avec votre soutien, nous recherchons constamment des moyens de faire avancer le développement humain, tout en tirant sans cesse les enseignements de l’expérience et en nous améliorant par la même occasion. À l’approche du Sommet des ODD de septembre, nous sommes arrivés à un moment particulièrement crucial pour relancer l’action en faveur des Objectifs mondiaux. Aujourd’hui, j’évoquerai quelques-unes des manières dont un PNUD intelligent face à l’avenir (#futuresmart) emploie ses ressources le plus efficacement pour impulser des changements plus rapides et même transformateurs.
	


Rompre le cycle des crises 

10.    Toute vision du progrès repose sur la rupture du cycle de la fragilité. Pour dire les choses telles qu’elles sont, nous n’avancerons jamais si ce cycle se poursuit. Environ 15 % de la population mondiale vit dans une zone en conflit. Plus de la moitié de l’humanité, soit 4 milliards de personnes, a connu une catastrophe naturelle au cours des 20 dernières années.

11.    Le PNUD mène des opérations dans les 60 pays classés comme fragiles. Notre nouvelle offre face aux crises constitue notre plan — et notre plaidoyer — pour un changement de paradigme, où le développement participe pleinement à la rupture du cycle de la fragilité. L’apport d’une aide alimentaire, d’abris et de logements à un stade précoce des crises restera une mission essentielle, qui ne devrait cependant pas être perpétuelle. Nous devons tourner la page des situations où des personnes vivent dans des camps pendant 20 ans.

12.    L’offre du PNUD pour faire face aux crises fixe une orientation en s’inspirant de l’expérience et en s’appuyant sur les partenariats avec tous les principaux acteurs des secteurs de l’humanitaire et de la paix. Elle recoupe les fondamentaux du développement que sont notamment la création d’emplois, l’approvisionnement énergétique, la prestation de services et une gouvernance plus à l’écoute. Quelques exemples :

•    En Iraq, les efforts massifs déployés pour stabiliser les zones touchées par l’État islamique en rétablissant les services et les infrastructures ont largement contribué au retour au bercail de 4 millions de personnes. Nous avons adopté cette approche en Libye, qui repose sur des solutions locales inclusives de consolidation de la paix et de développement. Nous la réadaptons à présent dans le bassin du lac Tchad, dans la région du Liptako Gourma et au Mozambique.
•    En Ukraine, le PNUD, membre à part entière de l’équipe de pays des Nations Unies, a apporté un appui au maintien des services publics qui a permis de fournir des solutions de services numériques à plus de 18 millions de personnes, donnant accès à ces dernières aux prestations monétaires, aux subventions au logement et à d’autres produits essentiels, tout en mettant en place les conditions d’un meilleur accès pendant le relèvement et au-delà. Les petites et moyennes entreprises employant plus de 7 millions de personnes, le PNUD a aidé des organisations professionnelles regroupant plus de 10 000 entreprises à fournir des services d’appui destinés à des opérations résilientes. Depuis octobre, nous aidons à réparer les infrastructures énergétiques afin de maintenir durablement les approvisionnements en électricité, gaz et eau.
•    En Afghanistan, le PNUD travaille sur les moyens de subsistance, en particulier pour les femmes et les jeunes, au niveau local, en collaborant étroitement avec les collectivités locales et 18 institutions spécialisées des Nations Unies et 36 organisations non gouvernementales (y compris des obligations internationales). Nous avons aidé à consolider les économies locales et à accroître les revenus des ménages, et à remettre en état les infrastructures et services d’énergie, d’eau et d’atténuation des effets des catastrophes. Les premiers résultats sont prometteurs. Dans le cadre du programme ABADEI, nous avons soutenu les moyens de subsistance de plus de 700 000 personnes en 2022 et apporté des solutions énergétiques propres à plus de 100 000 personnes. Nous continuons de plaider en faveur du droit des femmes et des filles à l’éducation, au travail et à la vie publique, par exemple en accordant la priorité à la réouverture de 34 000 petites entreprises appartenant à des femmes au moyen de microfinancements et de formations. Malgré les circonstances très difficiles, nous avons exécuté la quasi-totalité de notre programme en 2022, et nous devons poursuivre cette lancée cette année.
•    En République centrafricaine, nous nous sommes associés à la mission de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies pour soutenir la Cour pénale spéciale. En 2022, cette cour a franchi une étape décisive pour la justice : la prononciation du premier verdict contre des personnes accusées de crimes contre l’humanité et de crimes de guerre.

13.    Le nouveau Programme d’action en 10 points du PNUD pour l’égalité des sexes dans les situations de crise établit un lien entre nos interventions contre les crises et nos réponses à la question de la parité femmes-hommes. En collaboration avec ONU Femmes et d’autres partenaires, notre Mécanisme d’intervention en faveur de l’égalité des sexes et contre les crises et notre Plateforme de justice pour l’égalité des sexes partagent leurs connaissances et accélèrent l’action collective sur le leadership des femmes, leur autonomisation économique, leurs droits humains et leur accès à la justice.

Un développement résilient et décarboné

14.    L’un de nos choix les plus importants que nous devons opérer aujourd’hui, c’est celui de décarboner. Nous avons encore du chemin, mais l’action climatique nationale est plus ambitieuse que jamais, notamment grâce à la Climate Promise du PNUD. Il s’agit probablement du programme le plus complet de ce type, parce qu’il répond aux besoins des secteurs économiques de premier plan et de divers groupes de population, en prêtant la même attention à l’adaptation et à l’atténuation et à une transition juste.

15.    Des plans d’action climatique plus ambitieux ou des contributions déterminées au niveau national (CDN) étaient en grande partie en place en 2022 dans les 120 pays et territoires bénéficiant de la Climate Promise à ce jour. Il incombe désormais aux États du monde entier de les financer, les mettre en œuvre et les suivre à l’échelle et à la vitesse qu’exige l’action climatique. Le PNUD se félicite de l’engagement pris récemment lors des négociations mondiales sur le climat de mettre en place un mécanisme de financement pour compenser les « pertes et dommages » liés au climat. Qu’à cela ne tienne, il reste un impératif constant et distinct, qui est d’honorer l’engagement international d’affecter 100 milliards de dollars par an à l’action climatique dans les pays en développement.  

16.    La Climate Promise du PNUD a aidé 56 pays à élaborer des stratégies de financement afin d’utiliser au mieux les fonds climatiques. Le Libéria a à la fois conçu une stratégie globale de financement de l’action climatique et formé des fonctionnaires à la préparation des propositions budgétaires liées au climat afin que l’action climatique soit financée pas seulement pour un ministère, mais pour beaucoup d’entre eux. Le Bangladesh a établi une nouvelle norme mondiale pour un plan national d’adaptation détaillé qui fait des investissements à long terme une priorité, en mettant à contribution les ressources publiques comme privées. Un partenariat mondial avec le Fonds monétaire international a permis de mettre au point des techniques de nouvelle génération pour intégrer le climat dans les fondamentaux de la comptabilité nationale.

17.    Grâce à la Climate Promise, plus de 75 pays — nombre qui augmente chaque année — ont acquis de meilleurs systèmes de données et de mesure climatiques afin de maintenir les progrès sur la bonne voie. Le Viet Nam dispose d’outils de suivi du secteur privé dans son inventaire national des émissions. Malgré des années de troubles politiques et économiques, le Liban a produit l’un des inventaires des émissions les plus robustes et les plus transparents qui soient à ce jour.

18.    L’initiative phare du PNUD sur les paiements carbone au service du développement (Carbon Payments for Development), mise en œuvre en collaboration avec la Suisse, met 120 millions de dollars à disposition pour financer des paiements basés sur la performance dans le but de réduire les émissions. En 2022, ce programme a aidé les pays à commencer à mettre en application l’article 6 de l’Accord de Paris, qui vise à stimuler l’ambition climatique grâce à une collaboration accrue. Le premier projet au monde lié à l’article 6 a été lancé au Ghana pour encourager la plantation de cultures climato-intelligentes sur 15 000 hectares.

19.    Dans plus de 140 pays, le PNUD soutient l’action en faveur de l’adaptation au changement climatique en partenariat avec le Fonds pour l’environnement mondial et le Fonds vert pour le climat. Au Timor-Leste, des femmes ingénieures et des entreprises de construction locales réalisent des infrastructures à l’épreuve du climat dont bénéficieront 15 % de la population. Aux Tuvalu, la technologie de pointe montée sur des avions appelée LIDAR a permis de recueillir des informations de base détaillées sur les aléas marins et les processus côtiers qui seront précieuses pour l’adaptation à l’élévation du niveau de la mer.

20.    La transition vers un développement décarboné ouvre d’immenses possibilités de renforcer la résilience et de briser les cycles d’inégalité et d’exclusion. Le PNUD a déjà pris des mesures pour atteindre son objectif collectif d’accroître l’accès de 500 millions de personnes à une énergie propre et d’un coût abordable. Notre plus vaste initiative d’élargissement de l’accès aux énergies vertes, le Programme de mini-réseaux en Afrique, présente un énorme potentiel. Avec le financement du Fonds pour l’environnement mondial et l’expertise de RMI, l’un des principaux promoteurs de la transformation des systèmes énergétiques, ainsi que de la Banque africaine de développement, ce programme aidera à saisir une opportunité d’investissement de 65 milliards de dollars qui pourrait permettre de réaliser 114 000 mini-réseaux de batteries solaires dans 21 pays. Ces projets pourraient permettre d’apporter de l’électricité moderne à 265 millions de personnes, à plus de 200 000 écoles et dispensaires et à plus de 900 000 entreprises. Le programme aura un impact véritablement transformateur sur les communautés rurales pauvres qui autrement pourraient devoir attendre des décennies pour que les réseaux électriques traditionnels arrivent chez eux. Les mini-réseaux peuvent être construits en six semaines à peine, ce qui constitue le moyen le plus rapide et le moins onéreux d’accéder à l’électricité verte.

Le numérique comme force pour l’intérêt général 

21.    L’avenir, c’est le numérique, qui définit comment nous allons vivre, travailler et interagir les uns avec les autres. Les choix que nous ferons maintenant détermineront si la technologie devient une force d’autonomisation positive ou une source de nouvelles divisions et exclusions. C’est la raison pour laquelle le PNUD a investi dans son propre développement numérique pour aussi bien appliquer les technologies les plus récentes à son travail et aider les pays en développement à tirer parti de la révolution numérique. Le numérique occupe une place de choix dans nos programmes de préparation pour l’avenir, qui visent à réaliser des gains humains, et pas seulement des gains purement technologiques. 

22.    À l’heure actuelle, 2,7 milliards de personnes, principalement dans les pays en développement, se trouvent du mauvais côté de la fracture numérique. Si elles y sont laissées, leur retard ne fera que se creuser. Selon une étude phare du PNUD et de l’Université de Denver, des investissements ciblés dans la numérisation, la protection sociale et l’économie verte pourraient réduire de 146 millions le nombre de personnes vivant dans l’extrême pauvreté d’ici 2030.  

23.    Le PNUD aide actuellement 100 pays à mettre au point des solutions numériques qui s’alignent étroitement sur les priorités nationales de développement, comme au Malawi, où un système d’identification numérique ultramoderne et centré sur la personne a permis d’améliorer les informations fiscales, de renforcer les mécanismes de vérification des comptes bancaires et d’économiser 20 millions de dollars de deniers publics grâce à la réduction de la fraude aux pensions de retraite. Les fonds économisés ont été affectés à un nouveau programme national de subventions aux agriculteurs vulnérables. Plus de 40 bureaux de pays du PNUD ont mis en place de nouveaux moyens d’action pour des initiatives de justice numérique. Dans l’État de Palestine, par exemple, un système open source de gestion des affaires judiciaires améliore l’efficacité et l’accès à la justice, en privilégiant les femmes réticentes à signaler les violences domestiques.

24.    Lors de l’Assemblée générale de 2022, le PNUD a coorganisé une manifestation de haut niveau avec la Digital Public Goods Alliance (l’Alliance pour les biens publics numériques) qui a contribué à galvaniser les soutiens à l’appui de l’infrastructure publique numérique. Des dirigeants du gouvernement, de la société civile, du monde des affaires, des organisations philanthropiques et des organisations internationales ont engagé près de 300 millions de dollars pour construire des « routes et réseaux électriques » numériques qui permettent l’interconnexion de diverses plateformes numériques et la fourniture par ces dernières de services fiables, de paiements, le partage de données, etc. Le PNUD a montré comment un système d’échange de données en Ukraine, basé sur des modèles éprouvés en Estonie et en Sierra Leone, a soutenu la protection sociale et la prestation de services malgré la guerre. La poursuite de la collaboration avec la Zone de libre-échange continentale africaine (ZLECAf), qui concerne les 54 États membres de l’Union africaine, est en train de donner naissance à un protocole numérique pour des échanges de données et des paiements sûrs et sécurisés qui accéléreront le commerce numérique à travers le continent.  

25.    Le PNUD co-dirige la Digital Public Goods Alliance pour mettre 160 solutions de développement open source (et ce nombre est appelé à évoluer) à la disposition de tous, pour tous les ODD. iVerify, par exemple, est un outil de vérification des faits animé par l’intelligence artificielle qui vise à lutter contre la mésinformation électorale et que le PNUD a expérimenté avec succès en Zambie avant de l’appliquer au Honduras, au Kenya et au Libéria. Notre partenariat de longue date avec Singapour a permis de diffuser les contributions notables de ce pays à la technologie dans l’administration publique, à l’instar d’un outil d’examen automatique permettant un meilleur accès des personnes handicapées aux services numériques.

26.    Le numérique étant en évolution constante — le futur c’est maintenant en effet —, le PNUD a mis au point de puissantes ressources telles que son Digital Development Compass (la boussole du développement numérique). Il s’agit du plus vaste recueil d’indicateurs numériques nationaux qui ait jamais existé, qui contribue à guider une transformation numérique inclusive qui touche l’ensemble de la société. La plateforme Digital X met en relation des solutions publiques et privées prêtes à l’emploi à des problèmes de développement urgents, plus de 100 solutions éprouvées étant ainsi disponibles. Notre partenariat avec EDISON Alliance a donné lieu au Digital Inclusion Navigator (le navigateur numérique pour l’inclusion), qui organise des ressources fondées sur des données probantes aux fins des services numériques dans les soins de santé, des services financiers et de l’éducation.

27.    Toutes les activités numériques du PNUD cadrent avec le Pacte numérique mondial et Notre Programme commun du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies. Sous la direction du Rwanda et de la Suède, ainsi que de l’envoyé spécial des Nations Unies pour les technologies, le PNUD continuera d’appliquer une approche centrée sur les pays dans le cadre de ce pacte et d’appeler à placer les personnes et leurs droits au cœur de la transformation numérique.

Toute idée peut changer demain 
    
28.    Si nous voulons répondre aux besoins maintenant et prétendre à un avenir meilleur, nous devons penser et agir différemment. Le réseau de laboratoires d’accélération de classe mondiale du PNUD repose sur l’idée qu’avec 8 milliards d’habitants sur la planète, nous disposons probablement d’un grand nombre de réponses aux problèmes actuels qu’il ne reste plus qu’à trouver, déployer à grande échelle et diffusion largement. Dans 115 pays, les laboratoires brisent le mode traditionnel de production des idées. Des communautés aux salles de conférence, ils mettent en relation des personnes qui souhaitent expérimenter, apprendre et déclencher le changement, dans les secteurs public et privé.

29.    Les laboratoires ont changé le mode de fonctionnement du PNUD, en améliorant sa souplesse d’intervention et sa réactivité, et ils sont rapidement devenus une ressource pour les gouvernements dans toutes les régions. Les travaux des laboratoires ont permis de mettre à jour les données sur la qualité de l’air à Buenos Aires (Argentine), d’améliorer la lutte contre la pollution atmosphérique en Inde et de renforcer la résilience climatique des petits agriculteurs en Égypte. Le Réseau des laboratoires d’accélération, le HoneyBee Network et la School of International and Public Affairs de l’Université Columbia collaborent à l’élaboration d’une cartographie novatrice des solutions énergétiques pour les communautés longtemps laissées en dehors des réseaux énergétiques nationaux.

30.    Toujours attentifs aux dernières tendances du développement, les laboratoires sont de plus en plus le moteur du leadership éclairé du PNUD. Lorsque la collaboration internationale entre six laboratoires a révélé 30 signaux qui changeaient la nature du travail, par exemple, le PNUD a publié à ce sujet un rapport qui a été largement couvert par les médias grand public et mis en vedette lors du Forum économique mondial. La collaboration actuelle de 24 laboratoires porte sur l’examen de l’activité économique informelle, qui s’est fortement développée depuis la pandémie, afin de redéfinir les réponses à apporter au sein du PNUD et avec des partenaires tels que l’Organisation internationale du Travail.

31.    Les laboratoires sont devenus un point de départ pour la collaboration croissante du PNUD avec le secteur privé. Près de la moitié des nouveaux partenaires des laboratoires sont des acteurs privés, avec un potentiel considérable d’accroissement des investissements dans les ODD à mesure que de nouveaux écosystèmes d’innovation prennent leur envol. À l’université Harvard, les étudiants en MBA utilisent une étude de cas sur les laboratoires pour examiner les stratégies d’investissement dans les technologies. Le PNUD est fier de collaborer avec Hyundai sur la plateforme « For Tomorrow », qui présente 72 innovations créées par des personnes provenant de 44 pays. Un documentaire auquel l’actrice Daisy Ridley prête sa voix, disponible sur Amazon et YouTube, raconte l’histoire d’innovateurs locaux et montre à quoi l’avenir peut ressembler si les décideurs écoutent et tirent des leçons. Des millions de personnes ont regardé ce documentaire et ses bandes-annonces.

Montrer la voie avec nos valeurs 

32.    Excellences, le PNUD montre la voie avec des idées et des programmes pour briser le cycle des crises et réaliser un développement de nouvelle génération. Nous montrons également la voie avec les valeurs inscrites dans la Charte des Nations Unies et le droit international, dans le droit fil de notre mandat et tenant compte de la réalité qui est que le développement inclusif et durable dépend d’une meilleure gouvernance, de la réalisation des droits humains et de la mise en phase étroite de tous les flux de financement.

33.    Notre prochaine stratégie en matière de gouvernance est axée sur la réduction des fractures, l’accès à la justice et l’élargissement des choix pour que chacun puisse prospérer. La stratégie associe innovation et longue expérience, ce qui amplifie les succès récents, tels que le travail sur la lutte contre la corruption, qui s’intéressent à des secteurs entiers pour y décourager la corruption et améliorer les résultats de développement. L’application de cette approche au secteur de la santé en Tunisie a permis de réduire les frais médicaux et d’accroître la satisfaction des patients dans certains hôpitaux publics. Des outils numériques ont été déployés dans le cadre de plusieurs initiatives dans le but d’améliorer la participation citoyenne, à l’instar de la plateforme Agora du Panama, qui a fait participer plus de 200 000 personnes à la formulation d’une nouvelle vision du développement national. En Somalie, nous sommes à la fois en train de renforcer les capacités de gouvernance locale et de changer le discours sur la fragmentation sociale en mettant l’accent sur les changements positifs et autonomisants que les individus apportent dans leurs communautés.

34.    Comme l’indique le Plan stratégique du PNUD, notre travail est essentiellement consacré aux personnes qui peuvent avoir le plus de mal à réaliser leurs droits parce qu’elles sont pauvres, enlisées dans des conflits ou piégées par des normes sociales discriminatoires. Nous nous félicitons de la récente évaluation formative de l’application du principe de ne laisser personne de côté, qui reconnaît que l’équité et l’égalité sont intrinsèques au travail du PNUD. Et nous accueillons favorablement les recommandations de cette évaluation, qui renforceront notre capacité à nous concentrer sur les causes profondes de la marginalisation.

35.    Dans le cadre de notre nouvelle stratégie relative à l’égalité des sexes pour 2022-2025, qui vise à débloquer de nombreuses sources de discrimination croisées, les progrès sont déjà manifestes dans le travail sur les violences sexistes, où nous intégrons des stratégies de prévention dans des programmes axés sur d’autres préoccupations fondamentales concernant le développement. Les premiers projets expérimentaux menés en Iraq et au Liban, qui s’inscrivent dans des programmes d’autonomisation économique et promotion de moyens de subsistance dans les communautés marginalisées, ont manifestement amélioré les attitudes à l’égard de l’égalité des sexes, modifié les normes qui considèrent les violences sexistes comme acceptables, et amené les hommes à être plus disposés à assumer un plus grand nombre de tâches ménagères. Cette innovation pourrait donner une impulsion importante à la fois à l’élimination de la violence et à l’accélération de nombreux ODD.

36.    Le PNUD a également apporté une contribution essentielle à l’élimination des violences sexistes par le biais de l’initiative Spotlight de l’Union européenne et de l’Organisation des Nations Unies, en étroite collaboration avec ONU Femmes, le FNUAP et l’UNICEF. Dix-sept pays d’Amérique latine, par exemple, pénalisent désormais les féminicides dans leur législation ou les ont ajoutés comme infraction pénale dans leur code pénal.

37.    En ce qui concerne les droits humains, les efforts déployés par le PNUD pour aider les pays à appliquer les recommandations de l’Examen périodique universel s’alignent davantage sur les plans nationaux pour les ODD. L’Albanie s’est appuyée sur ces recommandations pour adapter la riposte à la COVID-19 aux femmes aux prises avec de multiples formes de discrimination, notamment les Roms, et les femmes handicapées ou vivant en milieu rural. La Sierra Leone a aboli la peine de mort et promulgué des lois visant à élargir l’espace civique.

38.    En 2022, les institutions nationales des droits de l’homme soutenues par le PNUD ont joué un rôle majeur dans l’approbation par l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies du droit universel à un environnement propre, sain et durable. Nous avons publié une stratégie pour la justice environnementale afin de faire avancer cet engagement, en nous appuyant sur des réalisations telles que celles obtenues dans le cadre du Programme de microfinancements du FEM. Dans 127 pays, cette stratégie offre des possibilités aux peuples autochtones, aux femmes, aux jeunes et aux personnes handicapées d’exercer leurs droits et d’ouvrir la voie à un équilibre durable entre les peuples et la planète.

Mettre en phase tous les flux de financement 

39.    Excellences, l’avenir de la finance doit être celui où nous alignons tous les flux, publics et privés, sur un développement durable et inclusif. Dans l’intervalle, nous continuerons, par choix ou par inertie, de financer les fractures qui divisent notre monde et les pratiques qui menacent de le détruire. Comme point de départ crucial, le PNUD soutient l’appel lancé par le Secrétaire général des Nations Unies, notamment dans Notre Programme commun, à réformer l’architecture financière internationale afin de mieux servir les pays en développement.

40.    Le Pôle de financement durable du PNUD est unique en sa capacité à aider à aligner et débloquer des financements publics et privés à l’appui du développement durable dès maintenant et dans la poursuite d’un objectif de 1 000 milliards de dollars en faveur des ODD. Dans 145 pays, les initiatives de financement durable mettent en relation les gouvernements, le secteur privé et les institutions financières internationales afin d’accélérer les progrès sur les ODD grâce à des mesures telles que la réforme fiscale, les politiques de développement des marchés financiers, les cartes des investisseurs et la budgétisation tenant compte du genre. Les cadres de financement nationaux intégrés dans 86 pays constituent une plateforme toute faite pour le nouveau Plan de relance des ODD du Secrétaire général, qui vise à affecter 2 % du PIB mondial, soit environ 500 millions de dollars par an, au développement, aux interventions humanitaires et à l’action climatique, grâce à des prêts des banques de développement, à l’allégement de la dette, à la fourniture de liquidités et aux financements des bailleurs de fonds.

41.    Le PNUD collabore avec plus de 40 pays sur la restructuration de la dette et les obligations thématiques. À la fin de 2022, ces initiatives avaient généré plus de 11 milliards de dollars à l’appui des ODD et de l’action climatique. L’Uruguay vient d’émettre une obligation innovante de 1,5 milliard de dollars liée au développement durable qui prolonge l’échéance de la dette existante et permet de lever de nouveaux fonds tenant compte des objectifs climatiques et environnementaux. En évitant les projets prédéfinis, l’obligation garantit la souplesse dans l’adaptation des choix de dépenses à mesure que les besoins évoluent ou se font jour. Des incitations intégrées pour atteindre les objectifs aident à encadrer les dépenses. L’Uruguay n’est que le deuxième pays à émettre ce type d’obligations, qui a été très favorablement accueilli par le marché, générant près de 4 milliards de dollars d’ordres de la part de 188 investisseurs.

42.    Dans le cadre de l’approfondissement de la collaboration du PNUD avec les institutions financières internationales dans 77 pays, nous restons étroitement alignés sur les priorités de développement nationales en aidant à préparer des propositions d’investissement rationnelles et à exécuter des dons et des prêts. En Équateur, nous avons aidé le ministère des Finances à mettre en place des outils de marquage budgétaire pour suivre les financements nationaux consacrés à l’action climatique dans le cadre de l’accès à près d’un milliard de dollars de prêts des banques de développement, dont le premier prêt à l’appui des politiques de développement pour une reprise verte et résiliente de la Banque mondiale. Une assistance technique aide les villes ukrainiennes à utiliser un prêt de 300 millions d’euros de la BEI pour remettre en état des infrastructures énergétiques qui à la fois sont plus efficaces et atteignent un plus grand nombre de personnes.

43.    Le financement mixte public-privé sera l’un des grands axes de la Facilité pour la transition verte dans les États arabes que le PNUD lance avec la Banque islamique de développement. Il offre aux gouvernements, aux institutions financières, au secteur privé et aux partenaires de développement une ressource pour transformer les objectifs climatiques en projets rentables dans une région où seulement 1,5 % de l’énergie est renouvelable. L’un des nouveaux accords qui façonnent le marché a été conclu avec la Kuwait Finance House pour aligner les investissements de cette institution sur les ODD. Elle est l’une des plus grandes institutions financières islamiques au monde et dispose d’une capitalisation boursière de près de 30 milliards de dollars.

44.    Le Mécanisme de financement des assurances et des risques du PNUD met en relation des partenaires publics et privés pour couvrir les risques climatiques futurs pour les populations les plus vulnérables. Ciblant 20 pays dans un premier temps, il a commencé à déployer des solutions d’assurance protégeant près de 40 millions de personnes, et est en bonne voie pour atteindre 80 millions de personnes en 2023. Il s’agit là d’un excellent exemple du PNUD intelligent face à l’avenir (#futursmart), où nous réduisons les risques de pauvreté en déployant des stratégies de pointe en étroite collaboration avec les acteurs publics et privés. Et ce n’est que le début. Les nouveaux partenariats complémentaires comprennent une collaboration avec la Fondation Bill & Melinda Gates portant sur 14 millions de dollars pour expérimenter des solutions de résilience financière pour les petits exploitants agricoles. La collaboration avec Milliman, Inc. aidera les pays à développer la science et les compétences actuarielles ainsi que les marchés de l’assurance.

Un partenaire de choix imprégné dans une culture de haute performance 

45.    Tout ce dont j’ai parlé jusqu’ici montre comment le PNUD emploie les ressources que vous lui confiez pour faire promouvoir le développement humain, à grande échelle, dans le droit fil des ODD. Bien que nos comptes financiers pour l’exercice n’aient pas encore été clos, l’année 2022 a enregistré le deuxième plus haut niveau d’exécution des programmes en plus d’une décennie, atteignant environ 4,7 milliards de dollars. En Afrique, nous avons dépassé notre objectif annuel, en apportant 102 % de l’appui aux programmes prévu. En Amérique latine et dans les Caraïbes, nous avons atteint 114 %. Au plus fort de la pandémie, nous avons dépassé nos résultats institutionnels de 2021.

46.    Nous restons hautement responsables dans nos dépenses et nous suivons l’impact des fonds de développement, ayant reçu notre dix-septième opinion d’audit sans réserve consécutive concernant nos états financiers pour 2021. Le PNUD se félicite du rapport du Comité des commissaires aux comptes des Nations Unies et de sa conclusion générale selon laquelle le PNUD a clôturé l’année 2021 en bonne santé financière grâce à de saines pratiques de gestion financière, y compris des processus et des contrôles conçus pour maintenir ses dépenses dans les limites des ressources financières disponibles.

47.    Nous faisons partie des organisations les plus transparentes au monde, selon l’Indice international de transparence de l’aide. La qualité de nos évaluations décentralisées — un test décisif sur la façon dont nous tirons les leçons de notre travail sur le terrain et l’améliorons — continue de s’améliorer. Des évaluations externes indépendantes réalisées par le Réseau de mesures des performances des organisations multilatérales (MOPAN), le Gouvernement japonais et Publish What You Fund ainsi que l’enquête en cours du PNUD sur les partenariats ont confirmé que le PNUD est un partenaire de choix pour les pays donateurs et les pays bénéficiaires du programme.

48.    En 2022, le PNUD a donné la priorité aux efforts déployés par les entreprises pour diversifier ses partenariats pour le développement, en mettant clairement l’accent sur les institutions financières internationales et le secteur privé. Dans le but de faciliter la collaboration avec les entreprises, nous avons mis en place une nouvelle politique de garantie de crédit, une politique d’octroi de licences de propriété intellectuelle et des outils de vérification préalable numérisés. Des politiques nouvelles et renforcées sont en place pour lutter contre le blanchiment des capitaux et le financement du terrorisme.

49.    Au sein de la famille élargie du PNUD, le Fonds d’équipement des Nations Unies (FENU), le Programme des Volontaires des Nations Unies (VNU), l’UNOSSC et le Bureau des fonds d’affectation spéciale pluripartenaires (MPTO) —toutes des organisations que le PNUD héberge et soutient — continuent d’apporter des contributions essentielles en tant que partenaires de développement. En 2022, mécanisme de financement catalytique pour les pays les moins avancés, le FENU a soutenu des fonds mixtes de tierces parties pour lever plus de 400 millions de dollars de capitaux d’investissement, principalement pour les petites et moyennes entreprises et les municipalités. Le Programme VNU met plus de 12 000 volontaires au service de plus de 55 entités des Nations Unies et, pour promouvoir l’inclusion, a mobilisé près de 200 VNU handicapés et des volontaires représentant 177 nationalités, et a maintenu la parité entre les sexes parmi les VNU.
 
50.    L’UNOSSC, par le biais de l’Exposition mondiale pour le développement Sud-Sud, de South-South Galaxy et des fonds d’affectation spéciale, renforce l’appui du système des Nations Unies aux États membres pour tirer parti de la coopération Sud-Sud et triangulaire en vue d’un relèvement résilient et d’un développement durable. Le Bureau des fonds d’affectation spéciale pluripartenaires fournit des services de financement communs à l’ensemble du système des Nations Unies, ce qui permet d’obtenir des résultats conjoints transparents et intégrés dans un portefeuille diversifié. En 2022, le Bureau a fourni un montant record de 1,7 milliard de dollars à 120 institutions du système des Nations Unies et partenaires d’exécution pour soutenir des coalitions interinstitutionnelles importantes et innovantes afin de faire avancer les ODD.

51.    Le passage accéléré du PNUD des projets aux portefeuilles fait intervenir un nouveau cadre d’initiation aux portefeuilles. Il nous aide, ainsi que nos partenaires, à intégrer l’innovation et la réflexion sur les systèmes dans la manière dont nous programmons, suivons, évaluons et mobilisons les financements. Quarante-cinq pays ont déjà appliqué une approche par portefeuille logique, notamment pour élaborer plusieurs nouveaux programmes de pays. Les gouvernements nationaux, comme au Malawi, et les autorités locales, comme en Arménie, en Géorgie et en Macédoine du Nord, font partie des premiers à adopter cette approche. Les investisseurs précoces incluent le Danemark, qui a largement initié le changement grâce à un soutien de la Facilité pour l’innovation du PNUD, et l’Union européenne, qui a engagé 10 millions d’euros au titre de la poursuite d’une approche par portefeuille de la transformation urbaine en Europe et en Asie centrale. J’encourage davantage de partenaires à nous rejoindre dans cette démarche importante.

52.    Je suis heureux que le PNUD continue de redoubler d’efforts pour incarner les valeurs que nous défendons, par exemple en obligeant tous les bureaux à planifier et à rendre compte de l’innovation et de la numérisation, à créer un lieu de travail sûr, inclusif et équitable, et à respecter les normes sociales et environnementales. Chaque bureau du PNUD doit maintenant planifier et rendre compte des efforts visant à renforcer une culture du travail inclusive, exempte de discrimination, d’exploitation et/ou d’abus, y compris d’inconduite sexuelle. Des mesures de sauvegarde appropriées sont intégrées dans tous les programmes du PNUD, et nous sensibilisons nos partenaires d’exécution à nos normes d’inconduite sexuelle. Nous avons entrepris d’examiner la performance de l’équipe dans le cadre de nos rapports annuels, et communiquerons les conclusions à la réunion annuelle du Conseil d’administration en 2023.

53.    La certification du PNUD par Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE) — une évaluation mondiale et une certification commerciale de premier plan pour l’égalité des sexes sur le lieu de travail — témoigne des progrès accomplis par le PNUD vers la réalisation de l’égalité des sexes et la création d’un lieu de travail inclusif. Depuis 2020, nous avons redoublé d’efforts pour devenir une organisation activement antiraciste et promouvoir l’égalité, la justice et l’inclusion au sein de notre propre institution et à travers nos programmes. Dans la dernière enquête du PNUD auprès du personnel, 80 % des personnes interrogées ont indiqué que tous les employés sont traités avec dignité et respect, une proportion supérieure de 23 % au niveau de référence externe.

54.    En vue de réduire notre empreinte carbone opérationnelle de 50 % au cours des sept prochaines années, notre mécanisme de financement de l’initiative « Moonshot » a investi dans 72 initiatives, allant des véhicules électriques aux énergies renouvelables, dans les locaux du PNUD. Ces mesures ont réduit notre empreinte carbone liée à la consommation de l’électricité de 11,2 % tout en économisant plus de 730 000 dollars en coûts énergétiques chaque année. Aux côtés de l’Institut des Nations Unies pour la formation et la recherche (UNITAR) et du Conseil norvégien pour les réfugiés, et avec l’appui de l’Allemagne, nous nous employons à remplacer 400 groupes électrogènes diesel utilisés dans des contextes humanitaires dans cinq pays du Sahel. Il s’agit là d’une étape importante vers le changement de la dépendance des organisations humanitaires à l’égard de l’électricité produite par des combustibles fossiles coûteux et nocifs pour l’environnement.

55.    Excellences, pris ensemble, tous les résultats que j’ai décrits aujourd’hui sont ceux d’une organisation en mouvement, qui tire systématiquement les leçons de ses expériences et qui produit du concret. Au cours de l’année écoulée, alors que ses partenaires de développement avaient le plus besoin de lui, le PNUD s’est mobilisé et a fourni un soutien financier et technique plus important que jamais, d’une manière fiable, responsable et transparente.

56.    Pourtant, la réalité est que nous avons du mal à faire plus avec moins. Cette situation n’est pas tenable. Hors du PNUD, les pays en développement sont confrontés à un déficit de financement estimé à 4 200 milliards de dollars par an, ce qui soulève de plus en plus de questions : pourquoi les financements destinés au développement baissent-ils malgré l’explosion des besoins ? Nous posons cette même question aujourd’hui. Bien que nous soyons profondément conscients de la confiance et l’engagement continu de nos donateurs, qui ont maintenu ou accru leur financement du travail du PNUD, la baisse actuelle des contributions d’un nombre croissant de pays de l’OCDE à nos ressources de base est malheureusement l’une des pires de l’histoire du PNUD.

57.    Le problème n’est pas celui d’un manque de demande ou d’une faible optimisation des ressources. Bien au contraire, comme en témoignent la forte demande des services du PNUD et les bonnes notes que j’ai évoquées plus haut de la part de nombreux partenaires et évaluateurs. En octobre dernier, lorsque nous avons réuni notre réseau mondial de représentants des pays avec des représentants permanents des États membres pour discuter de l’avenir du développement. Ils ont lancé un vibrant appel au PNUD pour qu’il offre davantage d’aide aux pays en développement afin qu’ils se relèvent des crises actuelles et se remettent sur les rails dans la poursuite des ODD.

58.    En outre, même avec la baisse des financements de base, les contributions autres que celles de base ont augmenté en 2022 en raison de la confiance que les pays bénéficiaires des programmes placent en nous. L’Argentine, le Pakistan, la République démocratique du Congo et d’autres pays ont investi dans la collaboration avec nous en leur propre sein à des niveaux plus élevés que prévu. Un plus grand partage des coûts par les États témoigne des efforts continus déployés par le PNUD pour diversifier ses financements et accroître les contributions globales, mais il confirme également que les pays en développement votent avec leur portefeuille.

59.    En République démocratique du Congo, par exemple, le PNUD collabore avec le gouvernement et le Fonds monétaire international à la mise en œuvre d’un vaste programme de développement communautaire visant à améliorer les infrastructures locales, à fournir des énergies renouvelables hors réseau et à développer les liens commerciaux et les chaînes de valeur pour les petites entreprises des communautés marginalisées. Le programme a attiré 348 millions de dollars de ressources publiques et 263 millions de dollars de droits de tirage spéciaux.

60.    Les pays en développement ont également choisi le PNUD comme principal partenaire mondial pour l’accès à des milliards de dollars de financements et leur déploiement à l’appui du développement dans le cadre de fonds verticaux tels que le Fonds vert pour le climat, le Fonds pour l’environnement mondial, le Fonds multilatéral pour la mise en œuvre du Protocole de Montréal et le Fonds mondial de lutte contre le sida, la tuberculose et le paludisme. Le PNUD a placé la barre haut en matière de contrôle dans le cadre de son partenariat avec le Fonds pour l’environnement mondial, ce qui lui a valu le renouvellement de son accréditation en 2021. Notre niveau d’accréditation auprès du Fonds vert pour le climat a été relevé à la lumière des résultats que nous aidons à obtenir et des suites que nous donnons aux recommandations d’audit et d’évaluation. Certes, nous savons que nous pouvons et devons continuer à rechercher l’excellence, à respecter les normes élevées que nous nous sommes fixé et à les dépasser, mais nous sommes fiers d’être un partenaire de choix parmi les pays bénéficiaires de notre programme.

L’impact essentiel des ressources de base 

61.    Excellences, la baisse des financements de base est particulièrement problématique, au PNUD et dans l’ensemble du système des Nations Unies pour le développement, parce qu’elle taille dans le vif de nos organisations. La grande promesse de ce que nous avons commencé à entreprendre fera long feu si nous n’inversons pas immédiatement la tendance à la baisse des ressources de base. Celles-ci sont restées terriblement insuffisantes, se situant autour de 585 millions de dollars en 2022, soit 12 % de nos ressources totales, et devraient diminuer en 2023. Bien que ces chiffres ne soient pas encore définitifs alors que nous clôturons les comptes de 2022, cette baisse a une incidence directe sur notre capacité à réaliser les priorités du Plan stratégique que vous avez approuvé ainsi que les programmes nationaux convenus avec les pays bénéficiaires. Pour rendre compte de la valeur et du rôle des financements de base dans la pratique, je voudrais citer quelques exemples essentiels de ce qu’ils nous permettent de réaliser.

62.    Premièrement, 82 % de nos ressources de base programmatiques sont alloués aux pays à faible revenu. Dans les 46 pays les moins avancés, les ressources de base financent les programmes du PNUD qui luttent contre la pauvreté et les inégalités, s’attaquent aux causes profondes des crises et aident à réaliser la promesse que nous avons tous faite de ne laisser personne de côté. Les ressources de base sont essentielles à notre rôle de conseiller de confiance auprès des gouvernements, comme en ont témoigné de nombreux représentants des États membres lors de notre réunion d’octobre. Les ressources de base garantissent notre présence sur le terrain à intervenir avant, pendant et après les crises, grâce à des capacités souples et réactives, comme cela a été démontré récemment en Afghanistan.

63.    En Érythrée, les ressources de base contribuent à réduire certains des fossés de développement les plus profonds de notre époque. Dans les zones rurales, seulement 3 % de la population a accès à l’électricité, une disparité qui en entraîne beaucoup d’autres dans les domaines de l’éducation, de la santé, des revenus, de la sécurité, de l’accès au numérique et du poids inéquitable du travail domestique non rémunéré pour les femmes. Avec les ressources de base, le PNUD a accompli des progrès dans la réduction du déficit énergétique grâce à un mini-réseau solaire. Elles permettent de fournir de l’électricité moderne, abordable et durable à plus de 40 000 ménages et entreprises qui, autrement, n’auraient pas été raccordés au réseau électrique national. Le projet a transformé des moyens de subsistance et des vies, en apportant la lumière, littéralement, dans 40 villages, 500 petites entreprises, 15 écoles et deux hôpitaux communautaires. Faute de ressources de base pour répondre à ce besoin aigu, compte tenu de la complexité et du coût de l’extension de l’approvisionnement électrique traditionnel, ces communautés resteraient probablement dans l’obscurité, et les écarts de développement continueraient de se creuser.  

64.    Deuxièmement, les ressources de base déterminent en grande partie la qualité et la portée des innovations du PNUD en matière de leadership éclairé et de politiques publiques. Cela signifie que le PNUD peut régulièrement introduire de nouvelles idées qui transforment le travail de développement dans des domaines aussi divers que l’assurance, le financement durable, l’égalité des sexes, la numérisation et l’énergie, comme le confirment les nombreux exemples que j’ai évoqués précédemment. Les financements de base entretiennent le travail que nous avons entrepris il y a 30 ans lorsque notre Rapport sur le développement humain a mis en évidence la prédominance du PIB comme indicateur des progrès accomplis. Au cours des dernières années, ce rapport a façonné une compréhension globale de l’orientation de l’humanité, marquant la nouvelle ère de l’Anthropocène, présentant l’«ensemble d’incertitudes » et attirant l’attention sur l’impact brutal de la COVID-19 sur le développement humain.

65.    Parallèlement, notre indice de pauvreté multidimensionnelle, fruit d’une collaboration du PNUD avec l’Université d’Oxford, a permis de mieux cerner l’ampleur et la complexité de la pauvreté et de guider une nouvelle compréhension des solutions. Ces solutions concernent les énergies renouvelables, qui pourraient être l’un des moyens les plus rapides de sortir des privations multiples qui touchent 1,2 milliard de personnes. Toutes ces informations s’ajoutent aux données factuelles qui établissent le rôle indispensable de l’action multilatérale, aidant les dirigeants à plaider en faveur de l’investissement dans les ODD au lieu de se concentrer principalement sur des problèmes perçus comme « plus proches de chez eux ».

66.    Une nouvelle publication que nous allons lancer met en lumière les signaux de changement qui comptent le plus pour l’avenir du développement. Nos réseaux mondiaux de connaissances amplifient en permanence l’intelligence collective de 33 000 experts et professionnels du développement, et ont récemment ancré des dialogues mondiaux dans la période qui a précédé Stockholm+50. Le Réseau mondial pour les politiques du PNUD s’engage sur de nouveaux terrains intellectuels grâce à des recherches internes systématiques. Sa collection Development Futures, par exemple, sème de nouvelles idées dans de grandes revues consacrées au développement sur des questions émergentes telles que le rôle du secteur privé dans la consolidation de la paix et l’évaluation de la pauvreté multidimensionnelle tenant compte des risques.

67.    Troisièmement, les financements de base soutiennent le PNUD en tant qu’institution publique appartenant à tous, déterminée à défendre les valeurs de la Charte des Nations Unies et des ODD, avec le plus haut niveau de supervision qui soit. Ils sous-tendent notre approche fondée sur des valeurs, notre présence universelle, notre capacité de réponse en situation d’urgence et notre attachement à la transparence, à la responsabilité et à la supervision. Ils garantissent des améliorations constantes de l’efficacité institutionnelle, de l’agilité et de la responsabilité. Sur les ressources de base, le PNUD engage 50 millions de dollars par an pour des fonctions de supervision indépendantes et un appui aux fonctions à l’échelle du système, y compris pour le programme des Volontaires des Nations Unies, le FENU et l’UNOSSC.

68.    Les ressources de base ont rendu possible la mise en place de notre nouvelle plateforme de gestion Quantum tournée vers l’avenir, qui améliore la collaboration avec notre personnel, nos partenaires et nos fournisseurs. Cette plateforme combine plus de 10 000 éléments de données provenant d’activités opérationnelles et programmatiques pour recueillir de nouvelles informations et améliorer les décisions fondées sur les données. Dans le cadre de son engagement en faveur du programme de réforme des Nations Unies, le PNUD s’est associé à sept autres entités du système de développement pour déployer la plateforme Quantum : il s’agit du Fonds des Nations Unies pour la population (FNUAP), d’ONU-Femmes, du FENU, du programme VNU, de l’Université des Nations Unies, de l’UNOSSC et de l’UNITAR.

69.    Les canaux de paiement numérique de Quantum sont mis en place pour améliorer la détection des fraudes et le respect des normes de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent. La plateforme améliorera également la confidentialité des données, en s’appuyant sur l’engagement déjà ferme du PNUD en faveur d’un environnement de travail sécurisé pour les données, l’information et le numérique. En 2022, l’équipe du PNUD chargée de la cybersécurité a remporté le prix OSC50, qui récompense 50 cellules de cybersécurité les plus avancées au monde, aux côtés d’entreprises telles qu’Adobe, Accenture, Microsoft Corporation et Zoom. Ce prix témoigne de notre engagement continu à innover, à suivre les meilleures pratiques et à nous assurer que nous suivons l’évolution rapide du domaine de la cybersécurité. Le PNUD a remporté plus de prix OSC50 pour la cybersécurité que toute autre organisation, y compris du secteur privé.

70.    Grâce aux sources de base, le PNUD continue de faire avancer sa Stratégie relative aux ressources humaines à l’horizon 2030, après avoir remporté plusieurs prix mondiaux prestigieux pour la gestion des talents. Notre Programme pour les études supérieures a obtenu le prix 2022 pour le recrutement le plus efficace des nouveaux talents après avoir passé au crible efficacement plus de 38 000 candidats et sélectionné 33 candidats différents en moins de deux mois. Cela témoigne de l’intérêt des personnes à travailler pour le PNUD et de notre engagement continu à améliorer la diversité de notre personnel. De nouvelles ressources d’apprentissage et de perfectionnement du personnel sont destinées à renforcer les compétences en matière de recherche de sens, de planification de scénarios et de réflexion systémique. Cette année, nous mettrons en place de nouveaux mécanismes de rétroaction sur la performance et l’expérience des employés, approfondissant l’amélioration continue et l’innovation comme faisant partie intégrante de notre culture organisationnelle.

71.    Excellences, en bref, le PNUD a mis la barre haut pour être une institution publique plus axée sur la performance et plus efficace, et capable de se mettre au service de la coopération mondiale pour le développement parce qu’elle apprend et s’améliore constamment, en s’appuyant pour cela sur un examen rigoureux et des données probantes solides. Nous nous tournons vers vous pour saluer ce que nous avons accompli et dire combien nous pouvons encore accomplir avec des financements suffisants. Nous sommes prêts si vous l’êtes.  
 
L’avenir commence par nous 

72.    Nous traversons une période difficile pour beaucoup de gens. Elle peut nous changer d’une manière que nous ne pouvons encore imaginer. Pourtant, je vois une lueur d’espoir parce que beaucoup d’entre nous s’emploient à bâtir un monde meilleur, y compris ceux d’entre nous ici présents aujourd’hui. Un PNUD connecté, à l’écoute et prêt pour l’avenir est préparé à faire les choix qui nous feront avancer. En tant qu’organisation intégrée au système des Nations Unies et à l’écosystème plus large des partenaires de développement, il peut avoir un effet multiplicateur profond. Grâce à nos partenariats et en tant que catalyseur du changement, nous atteignons des millions de personnes à court terme tout en déclenchant des changements qui concourent à une plus grande inclusion et à une plus grande durabilité.

73.    Excellences, les progrès s’accélèrent souvent à la suite de la communication entre les personnes. Et avant même qu’on ne s’en rende compte, un mouvement se forme et gagne de l’élan. Je vous prierais donc de faire savoir ce qu’accomplit le PNUD dans vos capitales et au-delà. Le partage de ce que nous savons peut avoir un impact formidable. Les personnes qui espèrent un avenir meilleur et ont la conviction que cela est possible trouveront le moyen d’y parvenir."

               Moirũ: what we learned integrating community participation and social innovation      By: Mónica Ríos, Gustavo Setrini, Cristhian Parra, Ana Lucía Giménez*, Lucas McKinnon*       
		 21 de Abril de 2021

    
         
                            
Over the last two decades, Innovation contests and challenges have become common tools(link is external) for  addressing development challenges. Diverse institutions and organizations promote them as a way to stimulate creativity, collaboration, and rapid progress toward social and economic development(link is external).
The growing popularity of these methods has brought praise(link is external) of well-designed contests(link is external), as well as criticism (link is external)of their shortcomings (link is external)and recognition of the myriad(link is external) challenges(link is external) they face to be effective levers of innovation. Some of these challenges include Incorporating diverse perspectives(link is external) and experiences, making relevant knowledge(link is external) and resources(link is external) available, follow-up in the implementation of winning proposals, and evaluation of their impact. We believe that considering these challenges is particularly important when working on social innovation in vulnerable communities. 
Social innovation is both the process and product of identifying solutions, tools, and ideas to respond to a specific social problem(link is external). As a process, social innovation  attempts to invert the power dynamic often present in traditional innovation policy, by insisting on collaborative, communal, relevant and public knowledge-generation directly with and from the affected communities. 
Social innovation shifts our focus from a primary concern with technology, enterprise, and markets, toward a focus on social contexts, collective assets, and the creation of social value. In this one-size does not fit all mentality, social innovation programs are defined by a multiplicity of methodologies, which includes human-centered design, participatory action research, solutions mapping, and others applied by different Acceleration Labs in the UNDP network(link is external).

In Paraguay, the National SDG Commission(link is external) (Comisión ODS), the National Innovation Strategy (ENI)(link is external), and the Accelerator Lab have designed and launched  Moirũ Concurso Comunitario de Innovación Social(link is external), as a social innovation contest aligned with the first of five national innovation challenges(link is external) that ENI has defined through a yearlong participatory process: “Paraguay Protected and Resilient in the Face of Epidemics.” Moirũ’s first edition  was focused on innovation at the intersection of SDGs 2 and 5: Zero Hunge(link is external)r and Gender Equality(link is external).
Four features were particularly important for us to include in the design of the community social innovation challenge: (1) a primary focus on community organizations, as opposed to on firms and startups, as the main drivers of social change; (2) recognition of collective assets and commons, in addition to technology, as tools for inclusive innovation; (3) creating incentives for collaboration and collective intelligence, rather than relying solely on competitive incentives, and finally, (4) training participants in specific design and research methods to strengthening their proposals, building capacities for their communities. 
3. Moirũ in Practice
We approached the design and implementation of Moirũ’s first edition as a prototyping exercise, carried out according to a five-stage process, for which we developed solutions mapping(link is external) and challenge reframing(link is external) methodologies.

In Stage 1, reframing took the form of a facilitated (link is external)ORID dialogue(link is external) about challenges at the intersection of SDG 2: Zero Hunger and SDG 5: Gender Equality, with the participation of government, private sector, civil society and community leaders. We mapped the initiatives(link is external) that responded to the targeted challenge and identified 6 emerging barriers they faced for their growth and development.
Stage 2 drew on the diverse perspectives of our partners for the preselection of a subset of initiatives(link is external) with the best potential to address these barriers and engage in Stage 3, the co-creation(link is external) of proposals. For this we ran online(link is external) workshops(link is external), using Experience Mapping and causal diagrams(link is external) tools(link is external) as the means to facilitate self-reflection and mentoring.

In Stage 4,  the 18 preselected teams presented their proposals during a virtual event(link is external) for a public audience and a panel of domain experts from diverse institutional and professional backgrounds. Each presentation was followed by a Q&A. The goal was to use the combination of public(link is external) online(link is external) (30%) and expert (70%) deliberation to generate engagement and democratize the final results.

5. What we learned
In general, Moirũ met our expectations as  a novel social innovation method. It demonstrated the power of “popular knowledge” in creating a diversity of proposals, as well as the importance of collective decision-making. Reflecting on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the challenge, it is evident that solutions mapping is effective for engendering innovative solutions to structural issues through collaboration and community engagement. The reframing workshop rapidly narrowed their focus and helped clarify what primary efforts to support SDG 2 and 5 were already underway.
However, budget and timeline constraints pushed us to conduct the entire process in just under four months. Mapping solutions with broad and diverse participation requires more time. Analyzing and making sense of solutions mapped in this way, in order to define a relevant innovation challenge, takes even more time. Our intention was to then conduct an extended period of participatory solutions mapping focussed on the specific reframed challenges, populating the Wendá(link is external) platform with information about initiatives underway and potential solutions to be analyzed to further refine the challenge. However, the team was unable to mobilize participation of volunteers in the timeframe available, and as a result, we ended up collapsing the planned solutions mapping and application phases into a single stage, as described above. 

The team also found that, while the process of co-creating proposals is effective, it demands greater suspension from the competitive pressures created by the “contest format.” One-on-one work with semi-finalists over the course of the program was essential to overcome the apprehensions of participants. In particular, the “experience map” and “hypotheses diagram” offered a space where participants could express doubts, uncertainties, failures, or barriers they faced in their initiatives, contextualizing their proposal for their own benefit as well as the facilitators’. This openness created opportunities for ingenuity and constructive criticism among participants, rather than demanding the “airtight” performance of perfect applicants. 
In future editions, we hope to experiment with formats that incentivize collaboration and synergy among participants. The Equity-Centered Community Design(link is external) approach and other traditions of participatory design(link is external) might come handy in this quest to experiment with a full-fledge cooperative innovation challenge.  
Breaking the digital divide required consistent and active attention and recruiting local helpers to troubleshoot and manage the logistics of connectivity. In normal times, this might have been an insurmountable barrier. However, because all participants were restricted by a national quarantine, the digital format actually facilitated the participation of communities in geographically remote locations with very little or highly intermediated access to development and public institutions.

Finally, we observed that--with the right method--public voting and participation enhances the relevance and legitimacy of the winning proposals, greatly increases community engagement, and makes the contest more visible, bolstering community appropriation of the process and, hopefully, of the resulting project implementation. Specifically, two of the contest finalists were projects that were excluded from the top-5 ranking produced by the expert panel but which received an overwhelming amount of public votes. In addition, the expert ranking produced a tie among three proposals, but the public vote was significantly higher for one of the three, breaking the tie. 
Going forward, it could be interesting and perhaps valuable to explore and experiment with the expansion of decision-making by using other direct participation methods. This could be achieved perhaps through the inclusion of deliberative assemblies(link is external) with randomly selected community members from participating communities  with or through multiple phases feedback and proposal improvement, integrating institutional or other types of participants in different stages of deliberation and proposal making, furthering even more the diversity of the collective intelligence that emerges from the entire process.  

Despite these limitations, design research methods, mostly centered around qualitative analysis techniques and participatory action research principles, were key to enable a process that was emergent in nature, allowing for enough flexibility and uncertainty to co-exist with the more structured process that we needed to get to concrete winning proposals. Overall, we feel that this experience may represent a good example of an integrated research, development, and innovation cycle that can guide policy for an equally integrated science, technology, and innovation strategic agenda. 
6. What’s next? 
In the next posts in this series, we will present the 5 winners of the Moirũ Community Social Innovation Challenge, and of their ongoing and future projects. 
In future blogs we'll describe how Moirũ fits into a larger strategy for accelerating sustainable development. For the AccLabPy the real work of Moirũ began when the winners were announced. The initiatives must now implement their projects and confront the many systemic barriers to achieving food security and gender equality in their communities, these projects represent the first steps toward building portfolios of prototypes and experiments to speed social and policy innovation.Lea este blog en español aquí(link is external).

Moirū is a guaraní word that means to accompany one another. It comes from irū, which may mean partner or companion or fellow, and is closely connected to the word angirū, the guarani word for friend. Angirū combines ãnga, which means soul, with irū. To be friends in guaraní means to be soul partners, and that's the kind of fellowship and collaboration we hope to instill.

                                            By Jeremy Boy, with inputs from Mirko Ebelshaeuser and Drasko DraskovicThe 2025 UNDP Human Development Report(link is external) posits that making Artificial Intelligence (AI) a driver of human development is a matter of choice. The question is, who gets a say in making these choices? For the past five years, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network has been actively engaged in participatory data innovation and AI action research throughout Global Majority countries, whether it be through collective intelligence design; through national consultations and dialogues on AI with a wide variety of stakeholders, ranging from government to civil society; or through the use of generative AI to facilitate participatory processes.Following work we did last year with Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) graduate students to design a framework for conducting national dialogues on frontier technologies(link is external), we teamed up with our colleagues in UNDP’s Human Development Report Office to consult with and learn from Labs in 16 countries what they had picked up through their work on people’s perceptions of AI. All had concrete, practical experience of engaging with national stakeholders on the topic of AI, whether from government, private sector or civil society.Awareness of AI is growing, but deliberate use and understanding often remains limitedAll Labs reported a general awareness of AI from the many people they interacted with through their work—whether it be through reference to popular applications like ChatGPT, in terms of strategic business or institutional priorities, or simply as a concept. However, many also pointed out a limited depth of technical understanding, knowing when AI was embedded in commonly used systems or applications, or of the concrete possibilities offered by AI. Most Labs further reported that people, from TikTok content creators in Bangladesh to rural communities in Trinidad and Tobago, generally had mixed feelings about the deployment of AI, with perceptions varying from techno-optimism to considerable skepticism. Some issues raised were low digital literacy, limited public understanding of the possibilities offered by AI and that AI remained largely a “black box” for the general public and policymakers. Additionally, there is confusion around certain expectations that AI could be applied to almost anything. The Lab in Belarus highlighted a general positivity towards AI, with almost 50% of respondents to a nation-wide survey they conducted reaching 11K people affirming they trusted AI—albeit in most cases, on the condition that they understood how the algorithms worked. The Lab in Trinidad and Tobago mentioned that cautious optimism was often met with healthy skepticism, with 62% of respondents to a survey they conducted in six different locations around the country reaching 211 people mentioning mixed feelings about AI, and a clear divide on whether to trust AI to make decisions that could affect human lives (46% trust versus 42% distrust). Finally, speaking specifically about small shop owners, the Lab in Ecuador stated that people perceived AI as somewhat irrelevant in their day-to-day lives.This is in part due to the challenge of discussing AI as a monolithic technology: it can lead to misrepresentations, unrealistic expectations, and misplaced trust or distrust. There is a dire need for clarity about the possibilities that AI systems can offer, as well as their limitations, in different contexts and for different populations, sectors, and institutions. Conversations about AI need to be situated and based on concrete examples that resonate with people’s experiences.

           Going beyond AI literacy One way to anchor conversations about AI is to pay attention to the specific applications or use cases people refer to, and to use these as proxies for the broader socio-technical system. This can lead to insightful conversations about the perceived or anticipated implications of such applications. For example, the Lab in the Ukraine, reporting numbers from the Ministry of Digital Transformation’s White Paper on AI Regulation in the Ukraine(link is external), mentioned that 57% of the population were familiar with chatbots; the Lab in Paraguay claimed that civil society often associated AI with targeted ads; and the Lab in Bosnia and Herzegovina evoked some level of public awareness of more specialized applications like AI-assisted radiology and automated customer service. Conversely, the Lab in Guinea stated that individuals with limited digital literacy tended to refer to interacting with AI assistants as ""talking to robots,"" revealing a fear of not knowing who might be controlling them.  Many Labs also reported that people were concerned about AI-facilitated deepfakes and information integrity, data privacy and job replacements or displacements. This suggests that increasing people’s agency over AI is not just a matter of literacy. It is also a matter of demystifying how we collectively refer to and engage with the socio-technical system. This can enable people to seize opportunities, as well as engage in matters of concern and advocate for desirable technological futures. There is not one AI divide, but a multitude of intersecting AI dividesThe Labs highlighted important variations in awareness and understanding of AI, as well as inequities in access and opportunity, within countries and across socio-economic groups.  These include geographic divides, for example, between rural and urban areas; generational divides, with younger populations often appearing to be more informed and optimistic about AI; and gender divides, with women expressing less positivity about AI than men, as well as greater concerns about the potential misuse of their images to generate deepfakes. Just as it is problematic to discuss AI in monolithic terms, it is unrealistic to expect that it will uniformly permeate and impact different economies, societies and demographics around the world. It is important to critically assess where AI can truly make a positive impact on development, and for whom. Frontier technologies like AI need to be considered from national, and even local perspectives, not just from a global one.  
                 
            
    



        
            Incentives behind the development and deployment of AI need to be addressed The private sector is moving faster than the public sector’s ability to adopt or regulate AI, as many Labs confirmed. Several Labs also discussed infrastructural issues, as well as perceptions of colonial legacy, foreign influence and new dependencies. Others provided a reality check, suggesting that widespread adoption of AI was a distant mirage given the current digital landscape in their countries.For example, the Lab in Panama mentioned that academics thought most about the use of AI for productivity gains in the private sector, as opposed to its deployment in public services; the Labs in Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia noted that data and AI governance was a work in progress in their countries, and that regulations were taking time to be established. The Lab in North Macedonia further pointed out that discussions about AI were mainly driven by business, not by the government or civil society. The Lab in Colombia also shared the view that private companies were shaping the narrative and highlighted that while the country had an Ethical Framework for AI (Marco Ético para la IA(link is external)), there was a lack of mechanisms for verifying and enforcing compliance. The Lab in Ecuador further pondered how balancing sustainability with digital growth was a major challenge in the country.These international dynamics between private and public sectors raise important questions about balancing economic incentives—predominantly those of large, Global North conglomerates—and the global public good. There is a need to guarantee that the advantages of AI are distributed equitably, ensuring that those who contribute much of the primary resources such as data also benefit from the economic returns.Towards being more democratic about technologyBuilding trust and enabling greater agency over AI are critical endeavors. As UNDP actively works on re-imagining trust and safety for AI, we remain committed to including a plurality of voices from the Global Majority, as indeed, our collective technological futures should be a matter of choice. To this end, discrete consultations and engagements are necessary, but not enough. They need to be multiplied across all regions of the globe, even in places that may not be particularly AI ready and should be committed to “participation as justice(link is external),” i.e., a more continuous, long-term form of engagement that is based on mutual benefits, reciprocity, equity and justice. We encourage you to check out our framework for conducting national dialogues on frontier technologies, and to use it to foster more participation at your level, wherever you are. In doing so, we hope to move away from the paradigm of “democratizing technology” to one of being more democratic about technology.Full list of Labs represented: Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Argentina, Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Trinidad and Tobago, Guinea, Kenya, Morocco, Bangladesh. Methodological note: It is important to note that the insights reported in this blogpost are derived from subjective observations that are based on experience. They should be considered as signals rather than representative views held in any given country.

This new Digital Strategy will guide UNDP in its efforts to support countries to build inclusive, ethical, and sustainable digital societies. It also recognizes that digitalization will continue to re-shape how the organization responds to the monumental challenges our world now faces. That includes using its power to drive climate action and restore our natural world. And it will also complement the UN's wide-ranging global efforts to boost the digital capacity of vulnerable and marginalized groups including women and people with disabilities, for instance.
‍
In many ways, the Strategy will future proof the organization for the technological changes now and those yet to come, including advancing ways to boost the digital expertise of our personnel.
‍
This Digital Strategy demonstrates that UNDP refuses to stand still. With the Sustainable Development Goals serving as our guiding stars, we are looking beyond the immediate horizon to continue offering cutting-edge development support at the seminal moment for people and planet.
‍
I invite you to read the UNDP Digital Strategy and learn more.

                       Our digital journey so far

Digital technology is a fundamental force for change in this century, reshaping economies, government, and civil society – thereby impacting almost every aspect of development. The profound consequences and exponential pace of digital transformation demands both local action and global leadership to reimagine development in a digital age.
‍
Seized by the need to ensure relevance at this time of rapid digital change, UNDP launched its First Digital Strategy(link is external) to harness the power of digital technology and innovation to respond more effectively to development challenges. Building on a long history of project-level digital support for partners, the strategy represented a systematic and corporate-driven transformation process to reimagine the way UNDP serves its partners and operates its systems and processes.
‍
UNDP will continue to accelerate these efforts and support our development partners to ensure that the arc of future digital transformation protects human rights and leaves no one behind.
‍

In fact, UNDP has helped to adopt 580 digital solutions in 82 countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including 96 data collection systems, 71 e-commerce systems, 61 e-learning platforms, and 149 e-governance systems (September 2020 - September 2021).
  
    
       
            

 

 
  
                                           Digital Strategy
2022-2025

Building on the progress from the first strategy, the Digital Strategy 2022-2025 is intended to maintain and accelerate the momentum that has already been generated across UNDP and among its partners.

Vision 

With this strategy, UNDP puts forth a long-term vision to create a world in which digital is an empowering force for people and planet. This vision is closely aligned with the UNDP Strategic Plan 2022-2025(link is external), which outlines how UNDP will seek to support countries in three directions of change – structural transformation, leaving no one behind, and building resilience – and underlines the importance of digital(link is external) as one of three enablers to achieve this change.

This includes experimenting with new approaches and tools, scaling proven solutions, articulating the risks and challenges posed by digital technologies, and applying foresight to prepare for possible futures.
‍
UNDP will fully incorporate digital into each thematic area in a way that can guide the organization's practice, allowing for innovation to flourish while ensuring overall coherence in digital programming.
‍
Embedding digital in UNDP’s programming will be supported by the further rollout of Digital by Default, an approach in which digital outputs become a standard consideration of programme design and delivery.
  
    
        Empowering digital ecosystems              Support societies in their efforts to create more inclusive and resilient digital ecosystems(link is external).

This means supporting countries in their digital transformation journey at a societal level, and creating a network of actors and systems that ensures that human rights are protected and no one is left behind in this digital environment.

Digital transformation can be disruptive and, without concerted action, can bring risks such as loss of transparent system operation, loss of regulation, and increasing inequality. UNDP supports countries to not only harness the clear opportunities that digital technologies bring, but also ensure that those risks are considered and mitigated along the way.

Grounded in a whole-of-society approach(link is external), UNDP can support partners in adopting a holistic and inclusive approach when planning and designing digital public policy. Engaging a broader spectrum of stakeholders in digital innovation supports inclusive design that can empower vulnerable populations to access digital services, help to mitigate risks from digital platforms such as cybersecurity, misinformation and digital privacy concerns, and establish accountability. This work will be done in close collaboration with UN system partners and other development actors.
  
    
        Digitally native UNDP              Transform UNDP so that it has fit-for-purpose digital systems, processes, tools, and data, as well as a digitally competent workforce to effectively support the first two objectives.

UNDP will continue to develop an agile and innovative culture, to strengthen digital capacity building of UNDP personnel, and to attract a diverse and digitally capable talent pool. This will include ensuring that gender is embedded throughout digital activities.
‍
UNDP will lead by example and adopt best practices in the development and use of digital technologies, tools, and platforms to enhance our internal performance and render more effective services.
‍
Responsible data collection, management, use, and analysis are increasingly fundamental for UNDP’s work on the ground. UNDP will implement the forthcoming 2022 Data Strategy and Knowledge Management Strategy (currently in discussion) to ensure that UNDP becomes a data-driven organization with greater knowledge management capabilities.

                                           Guiding principles to digital transformation

As digital technology rapidly evolves, it is vital that UNDP’s approach to digital remains rooted in clear principles based on experience and international frameworks that put people and planet first.

UNDP commits to the following approach:

 
  
    
                       
  
    
       
            

 

 
  
                                           


UNDP puts human rights at the centre

Human rights will be at the centre of UNDP's approach to digital, as digital technologies increasingly mediate everything from health care, employment, education, to participation in social, cultural and political life. As digital technology evolves so does our understanding of its impact on human rights - whether positive or negative.



UNDP promotes inclusive and gender sensitive approaches that leave no one behind

UNDP advocates for digital transformation that is intentionally inclusive, and thoughtfully designed and implemented, to ensure that all processes put people at the centre. The aim of people-centred digital transformation is to build a more open, transparent, and accessible society that leaves no one behind.



UNDP contributes to shared global standards and frameworks that protect people’s rights

As digital transformation accelerates, UNDP will ensure that its digital work is aligned with and supports global standards such as the UN Charter4 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.



UNDP advocates for open digital standards and open data

UNDP advocates for open digital standards to unlock scale, reusability and interoperability. Leveraging digital public goods can unlock transformative solutions and digital infrastructures to enable a more equitable and transparent future, with a strong emphasis on protecting rights and preventing misuse.



UNDP works to strengthen local digital ecosystems

UNDP employs a whole-of-society approach and work with a new wave of leaders, companies, and digital innovators to develop thriving local digital ecosystems built on inclusivity, sustainability, accountability, and rights.



UNDP leverages strategic partnerships to catalyse inclusive approaches to digital development

Partnerships are critical to catalyse inclusive approaches to digital development, including the provision of adequate resources to implement the relevant international standards to safeguard and protect people.


  
    
       
            

 

 
  
                                           Why UNDP?

UNDP’s role and positioning in the digital development space, and therefore its ability to deliver on its Digital Strategy 2022-2025, stem from several defining features of the organization:

 
  
    
                       


Broad mandate and integrator role in the UN System

UNDP’s broad mandate on poverty and inequality enables the organization to play an integrator role in the UN System. This allows UNDP to maintain strong relationships with the central parts of governments, to leverage its thematic and technical experience across all SDGs, work across sectors and enable connections to take a holistic approach to digital transformation across society.



Longstanding expertise in supporting governments on digital transformation

UNDP has extensive experience in working with governments across all geographies and levels, providing neutral, expert, and independent support on diverse aspects of their digital transformation, from strategy to technology procurement, as well as convening across public and private sectors and capacity building.



Rights-based, intentionally inclusive, approach

Inclusion and the protection of human rights are core to UNDP’s mission. UNDP continues to advocate for and implement ‘intentionally inclusive’ approaches to digital development that place people at the centre. This includes longstanding expertise in developing ‘gender responsive’ approaches.



Proactive consideration of potential risks of digital technology

To anticipate and mitigate risks and harms of digital technologies, UNDP takes a critical and rigorous approach to the selection and application of digital solutions and partners. These risks can take different forms, the most serious of which are risks to human rights.



Unparalleled country presence

UNDP operates in 170 countries, including in fragile and conflict-affected areas. UNDP also has strong ties to local digital and innovation ecosystems through the Accelerator Lab Network, which has been set up in 91 locations covering 115 countries. This enables UNDP to develop solutions that are rooted in local ecosystems and which can be scaled and adapted to fit multiple contexts.

Each of theexperts holds their own foresight session,highlights potential technologicalbreakthroughs, draws direct parallels withthe processes currently taking place insidethese economies, whether these processesare going in the right direction or not, whatsteps could be taken to turn these processesin the right direction . We collect informationand prepare 3 reports on these 3 sectors ofthe economy.First of all, a methodology should be developeddescribing how experts will be selected, what programsand applications will be used in the process, whatresults are expected, etc.2.

                                            Digitalization stands as a driving force behind the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) worldwide, fostering significant progress across various sectors.Digital tools and resources have the potential to reform the delivery of public services and advance overall digital transformation. In Ghana, the drive  for  digitalization has exemplified the nation's commitment to harnessing technological advancements(link is external) to enhance the delivery of inclusive and efficient public services.Improved capacity to navigate and harness digital tools effectively has been identified as crucial in driving socioeconomic growth and fostering innovation. As a result, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) together with the National Information Technology Agency (NITA), with the support of the Ministry of Communications and Digitalization (MOCD) have strengthened the capacity of various government agencies to equip them with the necessary skills and expertise to accelerate inclusive digital transformation in Ghana.“As technology rapidly evolves in today's ever-changing landscape, it requires new skills and knowledge. UNDP is committed to supporting Ghana's digital progress by collaborating with its national partners, aiming to empower development through innovative digital solutions and skill development in the face of rapidly evolving technology,” noted Edward Ampratwum, Head of Governance & Inclusive Growth.The training aimed to improve the capacity of officials from across government institutions on digital public goods and digital public infrastructure concepts, shedding light on their role in the country's digital landscape. Digital public goods are open-source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, to do no harm and help attain the SDGs.Participants at the training underscored the importance of such capacity building exercises. Musah Issah, Director of Regulatory Affairs at NITA noted that “the training had broadened my perspective on digital infrastructure and public goods. Learning from this session would significantly influence my strategic approach in shaping and implementing regulatory policies for the digital sector.He emphasized that the knowledge gained would be instrumental in optimizing his techniques and practices for more effective governance within the rapidly evolving digital landscape.The training had participants from 10 government agencies. They were taken through topics such as digital public goods standards/requirements for registration, developing a prototype open standard or pilot for inclusive digital transformation, AI and digital transformation in government, and managing digital technology risks.The facilitators at the training included Mr. Seth Akumani, Head of Exploration at UNDP Ghana, Avinash Meetoo, a consultant, and Jacqueline Tsuma, UNDP Nigeria Digital Country Support Lead.

Humans have been trying to harness and master energy since the dawn of time. Let’s take fire as an example. Its harnessing was a fundamental milestone in the history of mankind. Fire not only provided light and warmth to protect us from the cold, but also made it possible to cook food, which led to a significant leap in our evolution as a species[1]. Cooking is also part of our culture; it involves establishing habits, transmitting learning, and generating significant memories. Let's now see another historic example: light. Humanity lived most of its history with no light during nights, with the discomfort and risks that this entailed[2].  The mastery of both reflects the fact that energy is a central factor in our quality of life, shaping our daily lives. However, problems related to energy access/distribution are not fully overcome. Many people are left behind.

The task of mapping territorial energy solutions entails changing the approach and, instead of focusing on large and traditional infrastructure projects, paying attention to how people-centered initiatives are being delivered. Through their identification, we highlight the potential to foster the development of multiple smaller-scale interventions in vulnerable communities to provide solutions that facilitate basic tasks such as: bathing or doing the laundry at a comfortable temperature, lighting or heating their homes, or cooking without indoor smoke, etc. Particularly, these solutions mapping focuses on renewable energy and addresses one of the major challenges of the climate crisis.

The mapped solutions primarily seek to supply heat and lighting, facilitate cooking, and act as systems. This is what we learned from these solutions:


	There is no one technology that can be applied in every situation. Depending on the situation they are to be used, technologies are either acceptable or not. In some locations with significant levels of solar radiation, solar energy-based solutions may be the natural choice over those that rely on other sources. It is then not surprising that the EcoAndina Foundation(link is external) is developing solar energy-based initiatives in the Puna. Uniqueness is a fundamental element; a device built to be used in one location with a certain level of radiation might quickly become obsolete in another context. Other solutions include harnessing wind energy to convert it into electricity. For example, 500RPM(link is external) stands out for releasing an open-patent wind turbine that can be self-built.
	Whether or not to adapt: Having access to technology does not imply a solution. Habits are equally important. As an example, and from an economic point of view, one may argue that solar stoves save the high cost related to gas for many vulnerable families. Another possibility is that some communities would greatly benefit from having solar stoves since they would no longer spend time gathering firewood, deal with problems associated with carrying it, or risk their health by breathing smoke indoor. However, its deployment requires different adaptations that cannot be taken for granted (cooking times that may depend on weather conditions, cooking outdoors, etc.). 
	Processes and organizational models do matter. Although technologies and inputs are replicated, there are differences in how the solutions function. It is interesting to see how communities harness them. As a result, a single technology may be used differently according to the local engagement and organization, for instance, when determining what is required.  Women provide a lesson in this sense in the next point.
	Women's roles in energy and gender. Women handle most of the domestic and care duties; in other words, they take care of many tasks  that require energy solutions, such as cooking food and preserving it, doing laundry or taking care of children, etc. Therefore, it is fundamental to consider their opinions. Some researchers did this in a small town in Salta where almost all the men work at high altitudes to earn a living and only the women and children remain in the area. In the summer, they appreciated the moment when they gather to wash their clothes using water basins exposed to the sun (which heat up in a couple of hours), but they dreaded having to do so with freezing water the rest of the year. As a result, a solar-powered community laundry[3](link is external) was created in the town to address what they considered to be an issue.
	Prototypes: From waste to input.  Many technologies were designed as prototypes and some of them were manufactured with recycled materials, waste, or very simple elements.  The use of this type of materials implies the possibility of scaling them at a different speed and being able to involve other communities in their creation. While Liter of light(link is external) uses plastic bottles to provide lighting fixtures. Sun Shower(link is external) uses bottles to install systems that store hot water on the house roofs so that their inhabitants can bathe with hot water.


By systematizing the solutions mapped, we observed that people affected by energy shortages tend to participate in design processes in different ways, either because they interact with members of the science, technology, and innovation ecosystem (researchers, teachers, students, entrepreneurs, etc.) or with civil society organizations with territorial presence. The forms of linkage vary and include iteration in the design of open hardware prototypes, participation in the development of participatory action research projects, participatory management, among others. This interaction entails an exchange of knowledge between people who know their problems very well and others who have technical knowledge that they use in the development of user-centered solutions.

There is definitely a lot to learn from these solutions. Therefore, at Co_Lab we decided to start a new cycle to further explore this mapping, to experiment in order to gain empirical evidence about what works, and to explore the opportunities and emerging trends related to renewable energies. We have plenty of energy to move forward.

18173,"","Four shades of blue in the CaribbeanUNDP Accelerator LabsFollow4 min read·Oct 16, 2019--ListenShareBy Tamaisha Eytle, Program Officer and Miguel Guirao, Eastern Caribbean Support OfficerAs you may have read in our last blog, for the emerging blue economy, the regional synergies with national private sector, public sector and development spaces are clear. So what are we doing to support this ecosystem? For the last four months we have been activating our contacts across the region to find the innovators, the changemakers and the idea-generators to get a better understanding of the growing blue landscape.As part of this ecosystem mapping we explored the trends and projects that innovators have developed, as well as other efforts around climate mitigation, adaptation, building resilience and creating climate solutions. To help with our sense-making initiatives, we also established the Blue Advisory Board made up of several partners from the development and the private sector. Each were asked a few basic questions:What are you doing that’s blue?What have you done that’s blue?What should we not do that’s blue?What should we do that’s blue?This input and dialogue provided a new stream of information and helped us garner and quickly identify a strategic direction for the Blue Lab. We also conducted a “Blue Tour” across the sub-region, engaging with both governments and the general public to gather more collective intelligence on the blue economy and learn from differing perspectives and local ideas. We also hosted a Blue Talk with the University of the West Indies (UWI), which brought together leading innovators to discuss strategies to better support small island developing states in integrating the sustainable development efforts for their ocean-based economic sectors. Additionally, we created the Blue Green Summit which brought together young activists and other local leaders to speak on the issues in the blue economy and to further harness the collective intelligence in the space.Our four exploration areasIn addition to our continuous community engagement, the Blue Lab believes in moving from engagement to action as a key pillar of the lab process. We have identified through our partner discussions some key areas of experimentation that are designed to tackle many key challenges and underlying issues that are current in the blue economy arena. At this stage, the below diagram indicates our first four areas of exploration.As part of our new approach, the top line indicates the overarching sectors for further exploration and below are the ideas or concepts that we are looking to test in making the region more Blue!For example:Tourism: We are developing a blue economy badge based on compliance to environmental attainment by piloting the Responsible Tourism Edition of the Oceanic Standards by Oceanic Global. This effort will help us to assess and determine whether sustainable tourism practices help to boost local tourism.Sargassum seaweed: With the increase in sargassum influx to the region over the last 5 years, governments and citizens are exploring ways to manage the increased volumes and find solutions to its potentially damaging effect on coastal ecosystems. In response, with the advent of the single-use plastic ban in Barbados and several other Caribbean countries, the Blue Lab will be working with Oasis Laboratory to pilot a biodegradable alternative to single-use plastic that is made out of sargassum. There are also efforts underway to explore alternative fertilizer solutions made from seaweed.Looking ahead, we can’t give away all our blue brainstorm ideas just yet, but here at the Blue Lab we aim to ensure we support the development of both policy and practice for problem-solving. To this end we will also enter a partnership with the University of the West Indies focusing on “Blue Economists,” an endeavor to marry research and policy and underpin our ongoing regional efforts.The future looks bright blue, and we invite you to join us as we ride our blue wave. Stay tuned to the blogosphere to find out more about these grassroots solutions and other problem solving activities our labs continue to develop to accelerate blue economy development in the region.***Tamaisha Eytle is Global Environment Facility’s Small Grants Programme Sub-Regional Associate Officer at UNDP Barbados and the OECS.

        MICM y PNUD Lanzan La Iniciativa Aceleración 2030 Mipymes Para Hacer Frente a Los Efectos de La COVID-19
      
        

      
               MICM y PNUD lanzan la iniciativa Aceleración 2030 Mipymes para hacer frente a los efectos de la COVID-19        
		 26 de Junio de 2020

    
         
                            Las entidades informaron que se trata de un llamado para presentar soluciones listas o en fase avanzada para ser implementadas en micro, pequeñas y medianas empresas, relacionadas con 3 temas: salud y seguridad ocupacional; medios de pagos ágiles; y logística y cadenas de distribución. Foto: Sandy Ramírez PNUD R. D.Santo Domingo.- El Ministerio de Industria, Comercio y Mipymes (MICM) y el Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD) lanzaron la iniciativa Aceleración 2030 Mipymes,con el objetivo de identificar experiencias e historias exitosas que hayan desarrollado las mipymes para mitigar los efectos de la COVID-19.
Los detalles del proyecto regional se anunciaron este martes 23 en un acto que se llevó a cabo en el Ministerio y que presidieron el viceministro de Fomento a las Mipymes, Ignacio Méndez, y el representante residente adjunto del PNUD, Xavier Hernández.
Las entidades informaron que se trata de un llamado para presentar soluciones listas o en fase avanzada para ser implementadas en micro, pequeñas y medianas empresas, relacionadas con 3 temas: salud y seguridad ocupacional; medios de pagos ágiles; y logística y cadenas de distribución.
La convocatoria busca identificar soluciones innovadoras para hacer frente a los efectos de la COVID19, como nuevas formas de hacer negocios, iniciativas de impacto social y aplicaciones tecnológicas exitosas. Está dirigida a los sectores público, privado, y académico de toda la región de América Latina y el Caribe, que pueden postularse a través de la plataforma www.aceleracion2030.com presentada en el lanzamiento.
Las mejores iniciativas serán difundidas en toda la región del Caribe y Latinoamérica. Además, las propuestas y casos de éxito serán incluidas en un reporte de inteligencia colectiva, para que gobiernos y organismos de cooperación internacional puedan identificar y apoyar aquellas que consideren viables y/o con la capacidad de replicarse en otras latitudes.
Hernández señaló que “Aceleración 2030 Mipymes es un ejemplo de cómo podemos de manera colaborativa sumar el talento, la creatividad y la capacidad de liderazgo de la región, aprovechando la capacidad de innovación de las micro, pequeñas y medianas empresas. Este sector representa un eje indispensable en la aceleración de procesos de recuperación en la región, para poder alcanzar los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible de la agenda 2030”.
Méndez señaló que “la convocatoria para el envío de las historias estará abierta hasta el 31 de julio y que las que resulten seleccionadas tendrán la oportunidad de conectar con laboratorios de aceleración del PNUD presentes en más de 78 países, los cuales ayudarían a que el negocio escale y sea más productivo”.
La iniciativa también cuenta con el apoyo de socios regionales como lo son la red de oficinas de PNUD, el Centro Regional de promoción de la MIPYME (CENPROMYPE), el Sistema de la Integración Centroamericana (SICA) y el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID).
En República Dominicana la COVID-19 ha obligado a la interrupción de muchas actividades productivas, afectando de forma acentuada a las mipymes, que emplean a 2.2 millones de personas, según datos del Fondo para el Financiamiento de la Microempresa (Fondomicro).
Desde el PNUD y el MICM se están uniendo esfuerzos para minimizar el impacto de esta crisis en el sector mipymes y garantizar una recuperación rápida, que al mismo tiempo permita importantes avances en sostenibilidad y resiliencia.

                                            UNDP Asia Pacific’s Women’s Mentoring Programme, was a profound personal, and professional experience. Participants discovered how to lead and recognize their potential. Tailored mentorship, paired with honest conversations helped participants navigate challenges and make informed decisions. Together, these tools provided invaluable insights and empowered participants to refine their leadership approaches, guiding them toward more strategic, confident decision-making. Here Aisha, Ananya, and Vipapone share insights to highlight how the programme has shaped them into confident and strategic leaders.  Building Confidence While confidence is often seen as an inherent trait, for many women in the programme, it was something we had to develop. In a supportive environment, we confronted insecurities and built self-assurance. One participant shared how her initial self-doubt gradually shifted as she became more assertive and develop a firm communication style, both professionally and personally. What began as a leadership development journey evolved into a process of self-discovery, where many of us came to recognize our value, build resilience, and find our voice. The programme didn’t just enhance our leadership skills; it empowered us to challenge the limitations we once placed on ourselves. For many, it was the first step toward leading with confidence.  Mentorship and Strategic Thinking  A key strength of the programme was the pairing of each participant with a senior leader, who along with their guidance also provided strategic insights into navigating the intricacies of UNDP. Mentors that are at the level of Resident Representative (RR), Deputy RR or higher, shared practical advice on understanding internal structures, making informed decisions, and thinking beyond day-to-day tasks. This tailored mentorship helped us to refine our leadership approaches, fostering a long-term, strategic mindset.  Networking One of the most valuable aspects of the programme was the peer group structure, which fostered candid discussions, feedback, and the exchange of ideas. More than just a support system, this network became a powerful tool for professional growth. One participant noted that, for the first time, she felt part of a larger ecosystem of women leaders facing similar challenges across the region. These connections transcended national boundaries and individual offices, creating a strong, cross-regional network of women committed to advancing leadership. Growth Through Small Steps Participants learned that significant change comes from small, consistent efforts. Aisha, for example, emphasized how simple practices—such as journaling and seeking feedback—led to meaningful progress in her leadership style. The mentorship programme underscored the importance of patience, reflection, and intentionality, and that small steps can lead to profound transformation. Importance of Diverse Leadership Perspectives  Participants from the Asia-Pacific region expressed a strong desire to learn from women who had successfully navigated similar socio-cultural challenges. This highlights the need for more inclusive leadership development, where gender diversity is accompanied by greater representation of voices from different regions and backgrounds, and reflects the communities it serves and is responsive to their unique challenges.  Engaging Men for Systemic Change  Despite big strides, gender parity challenges persist. In regions where patriarchal norms dominate, women’s voices are often marginalized, particularly in decision-making processes. Even now, some female staff speak of untoward disruptions by male staff when facilitating sessions, and report that women’s voices often take a back seat in workshops on inclusion. To achieve lasting change, efforts must be made to address systemic barriers, and men must be engaged as active partners in the pursuit of gender parity. This requires creating leadership structures that encourage collaboration and promote equal representation.  ConclusionWhile the Women’s Mentoring programme has successfully strengthened leadership skills and built networks, the journey toward true gender equality is ongoing. While it has fostered personal growth and self-awareness, to achieve sustainable change, we must continue to engage male allies and push for structural reforms that support inclusive leadership. By opening doors for individual advancement, the programme is helping to drive the broader mission of gender equality, leaving participants well-equipped to make meaningful contributions to development work across and beyond the region.  --This blog was co-authored by Aisha Marzuki (Strategic Learning and Visual Designer, UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub), Ananya Filbert (Human Resources Associate, UNDP India) and Vipapone (Tutu) Aphayvanh (Head of Programme Support Unit, UNDP Lao PDR) as well as edited by Cedric Monteiro (Regional Communications Specialist, UNDP Regional Hub)"

                         Son yıllarda, tüm dünyada Sürdürülebilir Kalkınma Amaçlarını (SKA'ları) anaakımlaştırmak ve evrensel olarak kabul edilen bu amaçlara 2030 yılına kadar ulaşmak için önemli ölçüde çaba sarf edildi. COVID-19 salgını başta olmak üzere birçok engelle karşılaşmış olsak da, SKA çerçevesi hâlâ bize insani gelişme ve çevrenin korunması gibi konularda anlamlı bir ilerleme sağlamaya doğru giden zorlu yolda rehberlik eden tek araç.

SKA çerçevesi kalkınma alanında günlük olarak kullanılsa da, araştırmalar halkın büyük bir çoğunluğunun buna hâlâ yabancı olduğunu gösteriyor[1]; çerçevenin kendisi bilinse bile, yapı taşları, altında yatan varsayımlar veya diğer önemli ayrıntılar genellikle tam olarak bilinmiyor. Birçok kuruluş, benim gibi kalkınma pratisyenlerinin düzenli olarak konuşma yaptığı farkındalık etkinlikleri düzenliyor, ancak bu tek seferlik etkinliklerde bilgi aktarımının seviyesi elbette sınırlı kalıyor. Pek çok çevrim içi kaynak da mevcut, ancak birçoğu halk tarafından bilinmediği için yeterince kullanılamıyor. Kısacası toplumda SKA farkındalığını ve bilgisini artırmak için yapılması gereken çok iş var. Bunu başarmak için de farklı araç ve yöntemler kullanmamız gerektiğini söylemeye gerek bile yok ve işte inovasyon burada yine karşımıza çıkıyor.

Birkaç hafta önce, yerel bir sivil toplum kuruluşu (STK) olan Kentimiz İzmir Derneği ile SKA temalı ve daha önce benzeri yapılmamış bir etkinlik tasarlama konusunda iş birliği fırsatlarını değerlendirmek için görüşmelere başladık. Söz konusu STK, misyonu doğrultusunda her yıl yüzlerce insanı bir araya getiren bir hazine avı düzenliyor. Amaç, katılımcıları bilmedikleri bir dizi yere göndererek İzmir’deki kültürel miras alanlarını öğrenmelerini sağlamak. Bu oldukça popüler bir etkinlik—aşağıdaki videoya göz atabilirsiniz—ve bir gelenek haline gelmiş durumda. Biz de bu etkinliği SKA’lar doğrultusunda uyarlamaya karar verdik. Yaratacağımız versiyonda amaç, katılımcılar arasında ve aktivite sırasında etraflarında gördükleriyle etkileşim yaratarak öğrenmenin potansiyelini maksimuma çıkarmak. Eğitim literatürü, bilgi üretme süreçlerinin birçok öğrenme yöntemi bir arada kullanıldığında, özellikle de yaparak öğrenmeyle, desteklendiğini savunuyor.[2]

İş birliğini çok ortaklı bir yapıyla güçlendirmek ve etkinliği SKA’lar üzerine geniş çaplı bir deney fırsatına dönüştürmek için İzmir Büyükşehir Belediyesi ve İzmir Sürdürülebilir Kentsel Gelişim Ağı (SKGA) gibi aktörleri de aramıza dahil ettik. Son birkaç haftada, yapılacak olan etkinliğin aşağıdaki özellikleri taşıması için nasıl tasarlanması gerektiğini konuştuk:


	Kapsayıcı;
	Engelli dostu;
	İklim dostu;
	Rekabet yerine iş birliğine dayalı;
	Pozitif etki yaratan; ve
	Deneysel.


Bu nitelikler SKA’larla uyumlu olduğu gibi, aynı zamanda işi organize edenler için de oldukça zorlayıcı. Onları çekici kılan özellikler, uygulanmalarını da zorlaştırıyor. Aslına bakarsanız, bu tür etkinliklerin çoğu kapsayıcılık, çevre veya pozitif etki göz önünde bulundurularak tasarlanmıyor. Diğer bir deyişle, model alabileceğimiz pek örnek bulunmuyor. 3 aydan kısa bir sürede ve önümüzde benzer bir örnek olmadan bu etkinliğin altından kalkmak için birlikte çalışacağız.

Belirlediğimiz beklentileri karşılamak istiyorsak bazı konuların üzerine dikkatlice düşünmemiz gerekiyor. Örneğin, şu sıralar ilgiyi yüksek tutmak için eğlenceyi ne düzeyde entegre etmemiz gerektiğini araştırıyorum—bu temel bir soru ve cevabı etkinliğin tüm kurgusunu etkileyecek. Oyunlaştırma giderek daha popüler hale gelmeye başladı ve eğlence faktörü genellikle yeterli katılımı sağlamak için gerekli görülüyor. Ancak düzenleyeceğimiz etkinlikte sürdürülebilirliğin ciddi bir iş olduğu gerçeğini de gözden kaçırmamak amacıyla ne kadar eğlencenin yeterli ne kadarının ise gerekenden fazla olduğuna karar vermemiz gerekiyor.

Benzer şekilde, katılımcıları rekabet mantığından uzaklaştırıp bunun yerine aralarında iş birliğini nasıl teşvik edeceğimizi bulmamız gerekiyor. Hazine avı etkinliklerinin çoğunda kazanan ve kaybedenlerin olacağı beklentisi vardır. Kazananlar genellikle tüm şifreleri en hızlı çözen, yerleri/nesneleri diğerlerinden önce bulan, mümkün olan en yüksek puanları toplayan veya bunların bazı kombinasyonlarını başaran ekipler arasından seçilir. Önümüzdeki en büyük zorluk, rekabeti teşvik etmemek için av konseptini yeniden tasarlamak—bariz nedenlerden dolayı ‘av’ kelimesiyle aram da pek iyi değil. Katılımcıları iş birliği yaptıklarında veya en azından belli bir düzeyde yardımlaştıklarında ödüllendirmenin yollarını bulmamız gerekiyor.

Aynı şey engelli ayrımcılığı için de geçerli. Kapsayıcılık ve engelli dostu olma ilkelerimize bağlı kalmak için, fiziksel yetenekleri ne olursa olsun herkesin katılımını mümkün kılmak için çabalamalıyız. Bunu yapmak, bazı fiziksel özelliklerin (koşma hızı, direnç veya kas gücü gibi) başarmanın en önemli belirleyicileri olacağı bir etkinlik yaratmanın önüne geçmemizi sağlayacaktır. Bugünlerde her takımda en az bir engelli veya yaşlı üyenin bulunmasını zorunlu kılma fikrini değerlendiriyoruz; bu kişiler etkinliğe uzaktan veya, doğru şartları sağlayabilirsek, fiziksel olarak katılabilirler. Etkinliklerin çoğu fiziksel engelleri dikkate alınmadan tasarlandığından bunlara katılamayan engelli bireyler için bunun ne anlama geldiğini hayal edebiliyor musunuz?

Son olarak, etki konusu bir kez daha zorlu bir mesele olarak karşımıza çıkıyor. Sadece birkaç saat süren tek seferlik bir aktiviteden ne tür bir etki ya da en azından sonuç bekleyebiliriz? Olumlu bir etki yaratmayı başarsak bile, bunu nasıl ölçeceğiz? Etkinliğin yarattığı herhangi bir etkinin uzun ömürlü olacağını iddia edebilir miyiz? Tasarım aşamasına geçmeden önce bu ve diğer birçok soruya acil yanıtlar bulmamız gerekiyor. Aksi takdirde, etki ölçümü düşünülmeden tasarlanmış ve pozitif sosyal etki yerine eğlenceyi önde tutan bir etkinliğin ortaya çıkma riski var.

Karşılaştığımız zorluklar üzerinde çalışırken, süreç boyunca tüm varsayımlarımızı, beklentilerimizi ve verdiğimiz kararları belgeliyoruz. Etkinliğin sonunda, aynı hedeflere ve/veya hassasiyetlere sahip benzer etkinliklerin farklı yerlerde nispeten hızlı ve kolay bir şekilde düzenlenebilmesi için en az bir bilgi çıktısı yayımlamayı umuyoruz. Önümüzde büyük bir ölçeklendirme fırsatı olduğunu ve başkalarının da bu etkinliği tekrarlamasını mümkün kılmak için öğrendiklerimizi paylaşmamız gerektiğini düşünüyorum.

       Reimagining Development for the 21st Century: Annual Report 2024   May 13, 2025                     2024 was a milestone year for the Accelerator Labs, UNDP’s open, globally distributed R&D capability. In 2024, the Network built on five years of global experimentation with innovation and development stakeholders to define, codify and share the how and the what of distributed bottom-up research and development (R&D) for sustainable development. UNDP’s largest investment in innovation and digital transformation to date, the Labs fortify a contribution to the UN 2.0 Quintet of Change(link is external) – a renewed playbook for the United Nations to address 21st century problems with 21st century skillsets.This report showcases the Network’s big bet in 2024: to transform the learning from its five years of cutting-edge experience in more than 100 countries into assets for the global community of development changemakers – from UNDP globally to governments to board members to local activists.

                                           My journey to becoming a Head of Experimentation and Digital Innovation Specialist at UNDP began, improbably enough, with a childhood fascination with broken radios and electronic devices. Growing up in Luque, Paraguay, I would spend hours taking apart electronics to understand how they worked, much to my parents' frustration when their appliances mysteriously stopped working.This curiosity led me to study electronics in high school, and computer engineering at the National University of Asunción(link is external), where I discovered how technology can help us solve complex problems. While still at University, I worked as a software developer, building systems for the University.  And, while I enjoyed the technical challenges, finding clever ways to work out complicated specs into code, I often found myself wondering about the human side of tech: Who was I really building this for? How and when were they using it? Did it really help or was I giving them more work to do?A Shift Toward Human-Centered TechnologyFast forward a few years, the opportunity came to pursue a PhD in Computer Science, specializing in Social Informatics and Human-Computer Interaction, in Trento, Italy. At the beginning, I was still highly focused on the computer side of systems, but halfway through my PhD, my advisor reached out and said: ""Cristhian, I no longer think your topic is of interest. From now on, I want to study happiness, and how technology can make us all live fuller lives. Care to join me?""His challenge led me to a 360-degree shift in my career, from one overtly focused on technology, to one more deeply connected to people and their needs. I started to do ethnographic research in Trento’s senior centers, where I spent over a year helping older adults interact with technology, observing their   struggles with all sorts of information and communication technologies, including a supposedly user-friendly app I had helped design. It was a humbling experience that exposed the pitfalls of assuming we understand users' needs without listening to them first.What started as ethnographic work became a participatory design experience. Spending years co-designing technology with older adults transformed my understanding of research, design and innovation. I learned that no matter how elegant the code, how interesting the tech, how transformative the solution, it is meaningless if it doesn’t start with the needs, prioritizing the lived experiences of real people. This lesson now guides my work every day.

           Returning to Paraguay: A New Path with UNDPAfter earning my PhD, I spent some years as a postdoctoral researcher, studying and designing systems to advance participatory democracy and community health initiatives. I eventually returned to Paraguay, eager to apply my research to real-world challenges in my home country as an applied design research scholar. This career path, however, felt limited, and I found myself searching for a way to create tangible change. That search led me to the UNDP Accelerator Lab, a global network designed to rethink development challenges through experimentation and collaborative problem-solving.Each lab is a small applied and participatory R&D unit, functioning as a testing ground for innovative approaches, bringing together governments, communities, and international partners to co-design and scale solutions for urgent social and environmental issues, such as improving public services, addressing climate change, or enhancing governance. And all of this while generating actionable evidence about what works, and what doesn’t, for human development. This ecosystem of experimentation not only identifies what works at the local level but also helps transform successful ideas into scalable solutions with global impact, through a network of more than 90 similar teams around the globe.Intrigued by its mission to drive sustainable development through innovation, I remember applying for all of its three open positions, only to be surprised when I qualified for every single one. I ultimately chose the role that seemed personally most challenging and best aligned with my own identity and passion for socio-technical community solutions: the role of the Experimenter.Transitioning from academia to UNDP was a defining moment in my career. Moving beyond a more rigorous type of research work to a more applied and pragmatic one, I found myself immersed in real-world problem-solving, where community needs and systemic constraints shape every initiative. Adapting to this new environment required me to bridge my analytical background with a more hands-on approach.The Accelerator lab onboarding boot camp in Rwanda introduced me to a dynamic global network of changemakers, showing me the power of collaboration in tackling development challenges. Working at UNDP has given me a profound sense of belonging to a global community driven by purpose. Driving Impact Through InnovationOne of our first projects focused on recycling, but soon after, the pandemic disrupted our plans. Adapting quickly, we developed rapid funding proposals to address COVID-19, an experience that highlighted the importance of agility and resilience. One of the first impactful activities that I contributed to was a participatory mapping and social articulation initiative called Wendá, which emerged during the pandemic. Prior to the formation of the lab in 2019, I had already established a relationship with people in the Government of Paraguay that were leading the National Strategy of Innovation, which played a significant role in shaping the direction of this initiative. We had the opportunity to contribute to their participatory planning process and they later used Wendá as the first enabler of their strategy. Wenda’s core objective was to make citizen initiatives visible, and collective action to address the immediate challenges posed by the pandemic. Through participatory workshops, we engaged social organizations and local communities in shaping the platform itself and coordinate pandemic-related responses, ensuring that critical efforts were not siloed but instead connected in a way that maximized collective impact. With time, the initiative evolved to become a place where different social innovation processes hosted part of their activities, adapting quickly to the emerging needs of the time. It was incredibly rewarding to work with the diversity of people that crossed paths through this. It reinforced my belief in the power of inclusive collaboration, especially during times of crisis.

           Another milestone that I’m proud of was my contribution to the Public Innovators Program. This capacity-building initiative was designed to empower government officials with the skills and knowledge needed to lead innovative efforts in public service. We focused on training civil servants in human-centered design, equipping them with tools to research, design and develop pilot projects that addressed pressing public service and policy challenges. The success of this program, which gained traction and secured funding from multiple partners, has been one of the most fulfilling parts of my journey within UNDP. It made me realize that the capacities we were bringing to the organization were needed across the system, and to develop them had the potential of creating a ripple effect that would lead to more sustainable, citizen-driven solutions. One last culminating rewarding moment happened during a detail assignment in Bhutan. I was tasked with coordinating and co-facilitating one of the Accelerator Lab’s codification fests, which gave me the chance of working closely with experimenters in the network in identifying and documenting our shared practices. This assignment gave me a deep sense of connection and purpose as I engaged directly with colleagues from all over the world and helped foster a strong collaborative spirit. At the end of our week together, the Prime Minister visited us and delivered an inspiring speech about the importance of local knowledge in the international cooperation system. Since I had taken on a leading role throughout the event, all eyes turned to me when he finished speaking, expecting a response. I stood up and, in the moment, delivered a brief but impactful reply. The positive feedback from my colleagues, especially the head of the lab who told me my remarks were “so on point,” was incredibly rewarding, and it not only deepened my connection with my peers but also reinforced the value of grassroot innovation and the participatory approaches we were championing through our work, reminding me of the power of community engagement and cultural sensitivity.Embracing Challenges and Lifelong LearningLooking back to these years at UNDP, I can now see how my background as an academic researcher has significantly enriched my work by giving me a solid foundation in research, design, and innovation methodologies, critical thinking, and evidence-based problem-solving. The ability to analyze complex social issues through the lens of technology and innovation has been invaluable in navigating development challenges. At the same time, these 5 years at UNDP meant for me to go deep into themes that were foreign to me, coming from a more technology-focused career. Each new challenge brought a lifelong learning opportunity to me, and this was one of the most exciting parts of my time at UNDP. In the past 2 years, however, I started to transition back  into the technology-intensive themes, as I became the Digital Advocate of our country office, allowing me to reconnect with my technical roots, crafting initiatives that harness technology for social good, integrating global capacity building offerings, like the Digital Fitness Program and the Data to Policy Workshop into the mix of training programs we facilitate for staff and government officials.So many other experiences shaped my journey during these 5 years. Collaborating with informal waste pickers in Asunción through participatory design in inclusive recycling projects. Leading participatory research with informal workers in the construction and textile industries. Facilitating research and design of initiatives with university students and local communities in social innovation challenges. Working with MSMEs of diverse sectors and territories to develop their productivity and digital maturity. Throughout my journey, I’ve learned that real impact comes from immersing oneself in the communities we serve. Whether working alongside informal waste pickers or facilitating co-creation workshops, understanding people’s lived experiences is crucial for meaningful change. Every single activity in the learning portfolio we built was a deeply rewarding experience that changed me forever (for the better).One of my proudest moments was seeing how one of the initiatives we championed, supporting MSMEs in their digital transformation, adopted a portfolio approach and evolved into a national program through partnerships with organizations like IADB (Inter-American Development Bank) and the Industry and Commerce Ministry, all aligning their expertise and resources towards the same objective and approach to develop the digital maturity of small businesses. I also feel particularly proud of the role I had the opportunity to play in an environmental initiative of our CO that promoted and strengthened a group of informal waste collectors, leading to a successful pilot for differentiated waste collection in our city. Witnessing these local efforts, and the learnings they generated, scale into larger systemic change or inspire new projects and interventions, has been deeply fulfilling.

           Looking Ahead: A Commitment to Innovation and ImpactAs I reflect on this journey, from dismantling broken radios in Luque to standing before the Prime Minister of Bhutan, I realize that my path has never been a straight line. It has been shaped by curiosity, by moments of doubt, by unexpected detours, and by the belief that technology should serve people, not the other way around.What excites me most about the future is the unknown. The problems we face as a global community are complex, but I have seen firsthand how research, development and innovation, when rooted in human connection and experiences, can drive real change. Whether it’s empowering informal waste collectors, mentoring young students, or collaborating with policymakers, I have learned that solutions don’t emerge from algorithms alone, they emerge from listening, from experimenting, and from embracing the messy, unpredictable nature of real-world challenges.For young professionals aspiring to make an impact, my advice is simple: say yes. Say yes to challenges that scare you, to opportunities that push you beyond your expertise, to the chance to make a difference, however small it may seem. Because often, it’s those small, unexpected moments that lead to the biggest transformations.As I continue my work with UNDP, I carry with me the stories of the people I’ve met, the lessons learned in the field, and the belief that technology, when designed and wielded with empathy and purpose, can help build a more just, sustainable, and inclusive world. The journey is far from over, if anything, it’s only just beginning."

           The Context Over the past few years, the Cambodia Country Office has made significant strides in embedding foresight into its ways of working. Horizon scanning  – the practice of observing and capturing signals of change – once an experimental side practice, has steadily grown into a core activity — shaping conversations, informing strategic planning, and cultivating a culture of future-consciousness across the office. Despite its momentum, a key challenge persisted: how to make horizon scanning actionable for colleagues in programme delivery. While signals helped teams consider the future, their connection to daily project decisions often felt abstract—helpful in theory, but difficult to apply practically. Recognising this gap, the Country Office set out to build a clearer bridge between foresight and implementation. Through three workshops, the team piloted a stress-testing process on its Circular Economy portfolio— linking emerging signals to specific interventions within the portfolio’s three pivots. In doing so, they moved foresight from the realm of the conceptual to the practical— providing tools to inform decisions, challenge assumptions, and improve strategic alignment.What emerged was not just a refined portfolio, but a renewed sense of what foresight can be: a practice that is rigorous, grounded, and accessible—even to sceptics. A way of working that doesn’t compete with programmatic priorities, but sharpens them.   
        
            These workshops really changed how people viewed foresight. By directly linking trends and signals to the practical challenges that colleagues were facing in projects and portfolios, the workshops made foresight feel less like an abstract strategic exercise and more like a concrete way of working.    Tum Nhim, Head of Solutions Mapping at UNDP Cambodia Accelerator Labs   
           The Process: Stress-testing the Circular Economy Portfolio The Circular Economy (CE) portfolio in Cambodia is structured around three strategic pivots: enabling government leadership, nurturing circular business and market growth, and cultivating conscious consumers and citizens. Each pivot is anchored in a core intent—ranging from strengthening the state’s capacity to champion CE reform, to mainstreaming inclusive business models, to fostering public awareness and engagement. The first phase focused on a targeted horizon scanning effort, which has already become second nature to the Cambodia CO. Beginning with an initial horizon scanning workshop in 2021, followed by a series of sense-making and scenario-building exercises throughout 2022, the CO developed its new Country Programme Document (CPD) for 2024–2028 with a distinctly futures-oriented lens. This journey culminated in the development of a Foresight Playbook tailored to the CO’s context—offering tools and prompts to embed strategic foresight across project cycles and institutional workflows.  
                                          After collecting over 80 new signals, the team clustered them into themes and trends through sense-making exercises. First, they prioritised themes relevant to the Cambodian context and then, they introduced a second dimension: the degree of uncertainty. Assessing signals and themes across both these dimensions enriched the dialogue about forces shaping the future—those we understand and can plan for, and those with ambiguous implications. By classifying themes along these two axes, the team could differentiate between “known certainties” that required immediate strategic alignment and “relevant uncertainties” that warranted more flexible, anticipatory responses.

           Each intervention was assessed for how directly it addressed each theme that emerged— using a green, yellow, or red traffic light system.       
    
                       The next phase involved mapping the Circular Economy portfolio against the “relevant and certain” trends. This step helped identify blind spots and challenge the portfolio's logic. Each intervention was assessed for how directly it addressed each trend— using a green, yellow, or red traffic light system.This participatory mapping revealed critical insights. For example, in Pivot 2, the team found significant private-sector skepticism about circular business models. In Pivot 3, it highlighted the need to embed CE into consumer consciousness, distinguishing it from other green initiatives.The final step, wind-tunnelling, pushed the team to confront uncertainty directly.   
    
       
           They explored two plausible future outcomes for each relevant but uncertain theme. For example, would the private sector adopt circular business models under supportive regulations, or would investments stay hesitant despite policy support? Would consumer concern for plastic pollution grow, or be overshadowed by urgent issues like food insecurity and water scarcity?Each intervention was then examined against these divergent futures. Could it succeed under both of these extreme outcomes, or would it need to adapt? If adaptation was necessary, what signals should be tracked to determine which way the theme might unfoldEven though a roadmap of planned interventions was already in place for each of these pivots, the stress-testing process created an opportunity for deeper reflection, prompting the team to revisit, refine, and in some cases, fundamentally rethink their design choices.  
           Outcomes & Impact: From Reflection to RedesignThis series of workshops proved both intellectually demanding and deeply generative. It illuminated not just risks, but also points of resilience.   
        
                                          Pivot 1: Enabling Government LeadershipInsightWhen the team mapped interventions under the first pivot, a critical theme emerged: although there was growing enthusiasm for Circular Economy principles, a stark capacity gap within public institutions remained. The risk was clear. Without adequate in-house expertise, the transition could stall at the policy level, leading to regulation that was either delayed, ineffective, or poorly enforced. Horizon scanning also highlighted a cautionary pattern observed elsewhere: when regulation was introduced without sufficient consultation or public preparedness, it sometimes faced backlash from industry or citizens. ActionThis insight led the team to recognise the urgent need for a better understanding of the underlying motivations and interests of different stakeholders.   
    
                       Pivot 2: Private Sector Engagement and Market GrowthInsightThe second pivot—centred on private sector engagement—surfaced another nuanced challenge. The signals collected raised questions about the real-world viability of Circular Economy business models and whether the ecosystem—financial, regulatory, and technical—was equipped to support their transition.ActionRather than abandon ambition, the team reframed their approach. They recognised that evidence speaks louder than advocacy. If private sector buy-in was essential, then proof points were needed—demonstrations of what works, under what conditions, and with what trade-offs. The roadmap was therefore restructured to prioritise ideation, prototyping, and incubation of circular business models. These would serve both as vehicles for innovation and as platforms for building confidence in the economic promise of circularity.  
    
                       Pivot 3: Conscious Consumers and Active CitizensInsightThe third pivot focused on the role of the public—not just as beneficiaries, but as drivers of change. However, the foresight process revealed that while climate change and environmental issues were gaining visibility, the specific value proposition of the Circular Economy remained poorly understood. There was a real risk that CE would be conflated with generic green initiatives, diluting its distinctiveness and undermining the effectiveness of communication campaigns.ActionThese reflections informed a strategic rethinking of planned interventions, ensuring that the portfolio supported both circular and green transitions. Communication strategies were recalibrated to better distinguish CE from broader environmental narratives, while outreach efforts were repositioned to emphasise practical, relatable entry points for the public.   
    
       
        
           While the technical outputs of the stress-testing workshops were significant—new insights, reprioritised interventions, and strengthened portfolios—the most powerful outcomes may have been less tangible yet more enduring. For many colleagues in the Country Office, this was the first time foresight felt truly accessible. In contrast to earlier horizon scanning exercises, which had helped develop a shared future-consciousness at the programme level, their influence on daily work at the project and portfolio levels often remained implicit—absorbed rather than applied. This time, something shifted.By directly linking trends and signals to the practical challenges that colleagues were facing in projects and portfolios, the workshops made foresight feel less like an abstract strategic exercise and more like a concrete way of working. Colleagues across the office, particularly those deeply engaged in programmatic delivery, began to view foresight not as a parallel function managed by the Accelerator Lab, but as a toolkit for making better decisions in real time.“These workshops really changed how people viewed foresight,” noted Tum, Head of Solutions Mapping at the Accelerator Lab. “Six months later, I was in a meeting with government partners, and to my surprise, it was our economist colleagues—the ones who are usually more inclined to the rigour of quantitative methods —who brought up the foresight stress-testing tools. They said the tools are very practical, structuring qualitative insights in a way that made them usable for government partners. That was a big moment for us. A small win, but one that showed just how deeply this approach had landed.”As teams engaged in mapping the initiatives across the three pivots—government leadership, private sector transformation, and consumer engagement—they also began to see the invisible threads that wove these efforts together. What initially appeared as discrete domains soon revealed themselves as deeply interdependent. This systems view—amplified through the stress-testing and wind-tunneling exercises—offered more than just design improvements. It became a source of strategic clarity.

                        “For me, one of the biggest shifts was confidence. Seeing how different pivots connect—and how those connections influence outcomes—has transformed how I discuss the work. 


And this clarity has been instrumental in my resource mobilisation efforts. In conversations with donors, I can now articulate how specific outcomes—like addressing marine waste—cannot be achieved through isolated interventions. That systems insight helps build trust and opens new possibilities for partnership.   Nac Mi, Portfolio Leader for the Circular Economy portfolio   
    
       
        
           This strategic coherence—linking insights from foresight to the pragmatics of pitching and partnering—highlights the broader value of embedding futures thinking into development portfolios. It is not just about planning better; it is about communicating more convincingly, aligning more deeply, and ultimately, delivering more impact.  
        
           Learnings & Next Steps Throughout the process one of the key learnings that emerged was that there is a need to actively counter bias during the entire exercise. Horizon scanning can easily become a box-ticking exercise if the team only focuses on known and local signals—policy dialogues, donor priorities, and sectoral needs already in play. This risks reinforcing existing assumptions rather than challenging them. For future iterations, the team considered designating a “Red Team” responsible for identifying counter-signals and emerging disruptions from regional and global contexts—ensuring that the foresight process doesn’t become a mirror of what we want to see but a window into multiple possible futures.Additionally, special care needs to be taken in facilitating this discussion. As expected, teams were often inclined to overrate their interventions, shying away from red flags. Introducing gamification—framing the task as “the team that can find the most red lights wins”— can prove helpful in shifting the mindset from defensiveness to curiosity. It also highlights the critical role of facilitation in foresight work, particularly in creating space for self-reflection and constructive critique.  
                                          Going Forward: Shifting Mindsets and Building CapacityLooking ahead, the Cambodia Country Office is exploring ways to build on the momentum sparked by this process. There is a growing appetite to institutionalise this stress-testing methodology—not only as an annual or biannual practice for the Circular Economy portfolio, but also as a framework to be applied across other priority portfolios within the office. The ambition extends beyond internal use. The team sees potential in sharing these tools with government counterparts, as the approach is practical and accessible. The team envisions this methodology as a stepping stone—both to deepen anticipatory capacity within UNDP and to support partners across various sectors to demonstrate that the future is not on some distant horizon, but is already shaping the choices we make today.   
    
                       “Foresight can sometimes feel abstract, or even a little too conceptual for people who work with data, plans, and operational decisions. 

What this process showed is that it doesn’t have to be. When foresight becomes a way to stress-test real initiatives, it suddenly becomes useful. And once it’s useful, it becomes empowering.”    Tum Nihm, Head of Solutions Mapping at UNDP Cambodia Accelerator Labs"

                                           En una esquina del centro de Luque se ubica una señora que desde hace años vende ensalada de frutas. Desde enero, sobre su vieja conservadora, ubicó un nuevo cartel, un pedazo de cartón escrito a mano: “alias C.I. 145…”. Significa que, desde ahora, ofrece a sus clientes la posibilidad de pagar a través de transferencias bancarias. Esta antigua vendedora que adopta nuevas tecnologías de pago refleja un punto de encuentro entre lo tradicional y lo moderno, donde la innovación transforma la manera en que los pequeños comerciantes manejan sus negocios. Es reflejo de una creciente tendencia en Paraguay: la bancarización y digitalización.Los datos corroboran esta escena. En septiembre de 2023, el Banco Central del Paraguay (BCP) lanzó nuevas funcionalidades para el Sistema de Pagos del Paraguay (SIPAP(link is external)), incluyendo el alias, una herramienta que permite realizar transferencias bancarias utilizando sólo el número de cédula, teléfono celular o correo electrónico. Desde su lanzamiento, se han realizado un total de 12 millones de transacciones por este método. Su crecimiento es exponencial. Más de la mitad de estas operaciones se realizaron sólo en los últimos tres meses del 2024.

                       Gráfico 1. Transferencias bancarias con alias de cuenta en Paraguay: Tendencias de Cantidad e Importe (2023-2025).La bancarización y adopción de herramientas tecnológicas para el cobro de servicios en la economía local viene acompañado de otros beneficios que brinda la digitalización a los negocios(link is external): la mejora de la eficiencia operacional, el acceso a nuevos mercados, el fortalecimiento general del ecosistema empresarial. Estos beneficios son particularmente importantes para las micro, pequeñas y medianas empresas (MIPYMES), quiénes representan el 98% del total de empresas y concentran el 73% del empleo en Paraguay. Existen más de 300.000 MIPYMES registradas en Paraguay, de las cuales el 96 % son microempresas (INE, 2024). Y se estima que existen otras 690.000 en el sector informal(link is external). Muchas de ellas, todavía no se han beneficiado de las posibilidades que otorgan las tecnologías, pero los avances en  infraestructura pública digital (p.ej., mejoras de SIPAP y del ecosistema de pagos digitales) y la mayor disponibilidad y accesibilidad de servicios digitales para las empresas, están creando el espacio de oportunidad ideal para impulsar una mayor inclusión financiera. a travès de la digitalización., Estas tendencias despertaron el interés del equipo del Laboratorio de Aceleración del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo de Paraguay, que desde el 2024 colabora además con el Ministerio de Industria y Comercio para el desarrollo de su portafolio de intervenciones de fortalecimiento del ecosistema emprendedor. ¿Qué tan preparadas están las MIPYMES para la transformación digital? ¿Cómo influye la digitalización en su productividad y formalización? ¿Qué herramientas digitales son más efectivas para distintos tipos de negocios? ¿Cómo optimizar la infraestructura digital pública para responder a las necesidades específicas de las MIPYMES? Estas son algunas de las interrogantes que surgen de este interés para guiar un nuevo ciclo de aprendizaje sobre “Digitalización y MIPYMES”, respaldado por recursos de la Ventana de Financiamiento en Pobreza y Desigualdad del PNUD, con el fin de generar conocimientos y experiencias prácticas que apoyen el fortalecimiento de capacidades intersectoriales, la formalización y el desarrollo de habilidades digitales de pequeños emprendimientos, así como apoyar la creación de infraestructuras y bienes digitales públicos que empoderen a las MIPYMES.EL CICLO DE APRENDIZAJE DE DIGITALIZACIÓN Y MIPYMES   
    
                                
    
                       Figura 1. Preguntas de Aprendizaje sobre Digitalización y MIPYMESExplorar estas interrogantes es fundamental en un contexto en el que la aceleración de las tecnologías digitales plantea tanto oportunidades como desafíos. Las empresas que logran integrar herramientas digitales suelen ser más competitivas, pero no todas las MIPYMES están en igual nivel de preparación para afrontar esta transformación. El nuevo ciclo de aprendizaje del AccLabPY aborda la Digitalización y las MIPYMES desde nuestra metodología de I+D participativa, aplicada al desarrollo sostenible. Nuestro ciclo empieza con el descubrimiento y exploración de en qué medida las MIPYMES de un territorio están preparadas para aprovechar las oportunidades que brinda la digitalización. En este blog post, resumimos algunos hallazgos de la primera etapa de esta exploración, en la que aprendimos que la digitalización puede generar beneficios clave, como la expansión de redes sociales, la eliminación de intermediarios y una mejor accesibilidad al crédito(link is external). Al mismo tiempo, existen oportunidades tentadoras para la formalización de empresas informales a través de la digitalización, como lo ha demostrado la experiencia en otros países. Ahora, el reto en Paraguay es explorar en qué medida las MIPYMES están listas para este cambio y qué herramientas pueden potenciar su desarrollo.PREPARACIÓN, ADOPCIÓN Y MADUREZ DIGITALEste ciclo se enfoca tanto en la adopción tecnológica, como también en comprender las diversas formas en que las MIPYMES pueden alcanzar la madurez digital, adaptándose a un entorno cada vez más dinámico. Modelos como el de Aceptación de Tecnología (TAM) o el de Tecnología-Organización-Ambiente (TOE) que revisamos en la etapa de preparación nos ayudaron a delinear herramientas de diagnóstico para evaluar la adopción de tecnologías digitales en este sector clave de la economía.La Preparación Digital (Digital Readiness) se refiere al grado en que una MIPYME está lista para implementar tecnologías digitales, lo que involucra su infraestructura tecnológica, el nivel de habilidades digitales de las y los empleados, la cultura organizacional, y la disposición de la empresa para adoptar cambios (Digital Acceptability). La aceptabilidad está relacionada con factores como la facilidad de uso de las herramientas, la formación y la percepción de beneficios.La Adopción Digital (Digital Adoption) se refiere al proceso mediante el cual una MIPYME incorpora y utiliza herramientas y tecnologías digitales en sus operaciones diarias. Esto puede incluir la adopción de software de gestión, plataformas de comercio electrónico, redes sociales y herramientas de análisis de datos. La adopción exitosa implica no solo la implementación de estas tecnologías, sino también su uso efectivo y continuo por parte de los empleados.La Madurez Digital (Digital Maturity) describe el nivel de desarrollo en el uso de tecnologías digitales dentro de la empresa. Un modelo de madurez digital puede evaluar aspectos como la tecnología y habilidades digitales; el uso de datos y analítica; la comunicación y canales de venta; los procesos; y el modelo de organización y personas Luego de explorar la literatura existente para medir niveles de madurez digital, identificamos la herramienta de autoaplicación denominada Chequeo Digital(link is external), desarrollada por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, que ya se ha implementado en varios países de la región y estaba todavía con poca adopción nivel local. Nos aliamos con universidades de cinco departamentos y siete Centros de Apoyo al Emprendedor, para aplicar esta encuesta en forma amplia, y contar con más datos que permitieran entender los desafíos. Así, este ciclo de aprendizaje representa una oportunidad de entender mejor las necesidades digitales de las MIPYMES y de contribuir a su fortalecimiento, apoyando la creación de un entorno más inclusivo y sostenible para el futuro de Paraguay.ALGUNOS HALLAZGOSAsí como la vendedora de ensaladas de frutas de Luque, identificamos numerosos emprendedores que estaban adaptando sus modos tradicionales de venta para aumentar sus intercambios comerciales. En la etapa exploratoria de este ciclo de aprendizaje identificamos y entrevistamos a varios casos exitosos, para aprender de sus experiencias. Entre las empresas locales en Paraguay que han adoptado diversos enfoques digitales para mejorar su visibilidad y ventas, destacamos una tienda online, un comercio de calzados, una tienda de alimentos saludables y una iniciativa social, que nos aportaron sus experiencias. Rebajas.com, por ejemplo, se destaca por ser una tienda 100% digital con un enfoque experto en logística y quema de stock. Su presidente es parte de la Cámara Paraguaya de Comercio Electrónico (CAPACE), lo que refleja su profundo compromiso con la industria.Por otro lado, negocios como La Onda Fit y Majo Gimenez Calzados demuestran la efectividad de las promociones en redes sociales. Mientras que Mundo Fit combina un enfoque personalizado con su cafetería en San Lorenzo, MajoCalzados utiliza las historias y lanzamientos en plataformas digitales para crear oportunidades de ventas.Empresas como Nuestras Manos  cuentan con una tienda física y online, y también han implementado herramientas digitales para pagos bancarizados y QR, además de utilizar embajadores en redes como TikTok para llegar a un público más amplio.EXPERIENCIAS EXITOSASLas y los emprendedores paraguayos a quienes entrevistamos destacaron que el éxito digital no solo depende de la presencia en línea, sino también de la capacidad para innovar y adaptarse. Algunos puntos que se destacaron entre las recomendaciones de los casos exitosos: Inversión en publicidad: El uso de plataformas como Facebook, Instagram, TikTok y Google Ads ha sido fundamental para atraer tráfico y visibilidad.Digitalización desde el inicio: Algunos emprendimientos nacieron con una estrategia digital clara, lo que facilitó su crecimiento en el comercio electrónico.Uso de encuestas y análisis de datos: Los entrevistados coincidieron en que las encuestas digitales permiten conocer mejor al cliente y ajustar las ofertas. Más allá de los descuentos, las promociones diarias adaptadas a los intereses añaden valor y mejoran la relación con los clientes. También destacan los reels en Instagram, una herramienta poderosa para segmentar al público y evaluar su aceptación.Contacto directo y personalizado: Otra clave del éxito. La interacción mediante WhatsApp Business ha sido clave para muchos emprendedores, permitiendo un seguimiento personalizado que muchas veces no se logra a través de una tienda online.Con respecto a los recursos digitales disponibles, el ecosistema emprendedor en Paraguay cuenta con una variedad de plataformas y herramientas que facilitan la transición digital. Algunas de las más destacadas por los emprendedores consultados son:Plataformas de delivery como Pedidos Ya y Uber Flash han permitido resolver desafíos logísticos, especialmente en fechas festivas.Fundación Paraguaya y su software gratuito para emprendedores.Shopify, una plataforma útil para ecommerce y análisis de datos.WhatsApp Business, que sigue siendo la herramienta preferida para ventas personalizadas.Además, programas como MIPYME Compite, apoyado por el MIC, y la Embajada de Estados Unidos han proporcionado capacitación y capital semilla a emprendedores.BARRERAS A SUPERARA pesar del éxito en muchos frentes, los emprendedores aún enfrentan limitaciones importantes para el comercio digital. Aunque muchas empresas han inaugurado sus tiendas online, la clientela paraguaya todavía prefiere comprar por WhatsApp, lo que refleja una resistencia a la automatización total. La falta de confianza en plataformas de pago ha frenado el cierre de ventas en línea.Otra barrera importante es la logística. La entrega de productos sigue siendo un reto, especialmente sin un sistema logístico confiable. Finalmente la falta de experiencias de asociatividad hace más complicado la incorporación de innovaciones, pues todo se hace como un aprendizaje solitario. Las y los emprendedores han señalado la falta de colaboración y experiencias conocidas de asociatividad como una barrera para el crecimiento colectivo.RECOMENDACIONES PARA EL ÉXITO DIGITALPara superar los desafíos que implican la innovación digital, los emprendedores deben adoptar ciertas estrategias clave. Según la experiencia de los casos exitosos consultados, la exposición personal es fundamental, ya que la clientela desea conocer a la persona detrás del producto, por lo que la transparencia y la presencia en redes sociales resultan esenciales para atraer nuevos compradores. Desde la experiencia de los emprendedores con buenas prácticas digitales, la bancarización es clave para aprovechar las oportunidades del comercio electrónico, por lo que es fundamental superar los mitos sobre las tarjetas bancarias y las cuentas, garantizando así un acceso más amplio y eficiente a los servicios financieros. Mencionaron que es necesario adaptarse a una atención omnicanal, usar varias herramientas complementarias. Por ejemplo, conectar a través de Instagram y cerrar las ventas por WhatsApp, sin descuidar la interacción personal, que sigue siendo un factor determinante. Finalmente, la proactividad en el aprendizaje permite a las y los emprendedores mantenerse actualizados en conocimientos tecnológicos, y la participación en programas de formación y certificaciones puede marcar una gran diferencia. En estas primeras etapas del Ciclo de Aprendizaje, hemos descubierto que en Paraguay hay una oferta abundante de programas de capacitación tanto a nivel nacional como internacional. Las instituciones como el MIC, CAPACE, la Fundación Paraguaya y plataformas como DreamBuilder y PLATZI ofrecen formación especializada para emprendedores. Los emprendedores pueden acceder a programas que ofrecen desde capital semilla hasta formación en marketing digital, gestión de inventarios, fotografía de productos, y más.En los próximos blogs de esta serie, exploraremos otras aristas de este ciclo, como:Sinergias Institucionales para el Desarrollo: ¿cómo estamos midiendo el nivel de madurez digital de las MIPYMES a través de una alianza estratégica entre el PNUD, el MIC y el BID?Patrones de digitalización de MIPYMES: ¿qué patrones nos muestran los resultados del Chequeo Digital de las Mipymes en Paraguay?Espíritu emprendedor y digitalización: ¿Cómo se relaciona la capacidad de innovación con la adopción de tecnologías digitales en las Mipymes?De Novatos a Expertos: ¿Cuáles son las principales barreras de acceso a la digitalización de las Mipymes y cómo superarlas? ¿Qué oportunidades de apoyo personalizado encontramos con el ecosistema emprendedor?Resultados de LOCAL DIGITAL: ¿Cuál es el resultado de las intervenciones de LOCAL Digital en Paraguay? ¿qué lecciones podemos aprender para futuros proyectos? ReferenciasBoletín Estadístico de Pagos del SIPAP- Diciembre, 2024.

                                           As the Head of Experimentation at UNDP Namibia, I have had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the incredible potential of our youth in driving climate action and innovation. Recently, I attended and co-facilitated  a workshop at the request of our Sustainable Environment Management, Energy and Resilience (SEMER)(link is external)  team, that brought together young minds from across Namibia to discuss and develop solutions for climate change. The experiences and insights gained from this event have inspired me to share some key takeaways and suggestions for our youth as they step into their roles as advocates for climate change.The Power of Networking and ExposureOne of the most significant observations from the workshop was the need for better and intentional networking among the youth. Exposure to events, workshops, and conferences can elevate the level of innovative solutions around grassroots innovation and local indigenous knowledge. Hence, there is a need for platforms to connect like-minded individuals, experts and young people to exchange ideas, learn from each other, and collaborate on projects that address climate change in meaningful ways.Creating Communities of PracticeRelated to networking and exposure, and to foster knowledge sharing and learning, it is also essential to create communities of practice. These communities could serve as platforms where youth can come together to discuss challenges, share successes, and learn from each other's experiences. These networks create safe learning spaces to ensure that valuable knowledge and innovative solutions are disseminated widely and effectively.Chat GPT for Climate Change?Interestingly enough, and not surprisingly, when listening to the pitching of solutions, I could not help but detect that ChatGPT had become a staple go-to, in a number of presentations. While I am a cautious advocate in embracing artificial intelligence (Ai), the reliance on large language models (LLMs) to developing solutions has to be accompanied by moving beyond what the model generates. The pitch session revealed that some solutions presented were typically Ai- Generated, which left me feeling that those presentations were devoid of context and personalization. To create impactful and relevant solutions, we must encourage our youth to delve deeper, contextualize their ideas, rely on the wisdom of their peers and infuse them with local knowledge and personal experiences.Embracing Creat-a-thons and Nature-Based SolutionsOne exciting way to foster innovation is through organising create-a-thons.  These are intensive, collaborative events where participants brainstorm and develop solutions in a short period. Additionally, nature-based solutions using biomimicry can offer sustainable and effective ways to address climate challenges. The work of our Accelerator Lab Colleagues in UNDP Ukraine and UNDP South Africa has shown that  looking to nature for inspiration, we can develop solutions that are both innovative and environmentally friendly.Encouraging Experimentation and CuriosityExperimentation and curiosity are the bedrock of innovation. We must encourage our youth to be curious, to ask questions, and to experiment with new ideas. Our UNDP Accelerator Lab in Panama(link is external) as well as Argentina(link is external) have embedded the use of Artificial Intelligence and citizen science to foster a culture of curiosity, experimentation and continuous learning. This is necessary for us to unlock the creative potential of our young people and drive forward-thinking solutions for climate change.Contextualizing Climate Change to NamibiaOne other observation at the workshop, is that context matters.  It is vital to contextualize climate change to Namibia and understand the relevance of climate change to our youth. Our country faces unique challenges, and our solutions must reflect our local realities. There is a need for us to align climate messaging with issues such as unemployment and resource inequality so that we can foster ownership and action.Using Social Media WiselySocial media is a powerful tool for advocacy, but it must be used wisely and intentionally. Instead of merely following influencers, our youth should use social media to share their stories, raise awareness, and mobilize action. The term “Be found doing” is a mantra that we have come to adopt as both inspiring and a call to action.  This mantra helps us embrace the need to actively engage in climate action and share efforts online, creating a snowball effect so that other young people can inspire others and create ripples of positive change.Holding Space for Each OtherOne of the most heartwarming moments of the workshop was witnessing how the youth held space for a young gentleman who stuttered but managed to communicate his message from the heart. This act of kindness and support exemplifies the hope for the future and for Namibia. It reminds us that, together, we can create a supportive and inclusive environment where every voice is heard and valued.Hope for the FutureThe workshop left me with a profound sense of hope for the future. Our youth are ready to lead, and they have the passion, creativity, and determination to drive meaningful change. By supporting them, providing opportunities for networking and learning, and encouraging innovation and experimentation, we can empower our young people to become champions of climate action.The future of Namibia lies in the hands of our youth. As a practitioner in the development space,  it is high time that we nurture their potential, support their efforts, and work together to create a sustainable and resilient future for our country. The journey ahead may be challenging, but with the collective efforts of our young people, we can overcome any obstacle and build a brighter tomorrow.

                                           ¿Qué desafíos enfrentamos para cerrar brechas y lograr más desarrollo sostenible? ¿Qué preguntas, viejas y nuevas, necesitamos responder para impulsar el desarrollo? ¿Cómo priorizamos temas para impulsar una agenda de aprendizaje para el desarrollo?Estas y más preguntas de aprendizaje guiaron una serie de talleres participativos en los que celebramos los 5 años del Laboratorio de Aceleración del PNUD en Paraguay, haciendo lo que misionalmente tenemos como mandato: hacernos preguntas para generar aprendizajes.En el primer blog de esta serie compartimos lo que fue el camino de la Red Global de Laboratorios de Aceleración y, específicamente, del Laboratorio de Aceleración en Paraguay en estos cinco años: los desafíos de frontera trazados, ciclos de aprendizaje llevados adelante, principios y tensiones que fortalecieron el proceso, y el camino andado en esta misión de generar investigación y desarrollo para catalizar el logro de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible.En este segundo blog exploramos las preguntas de aprendizaje que han surgido a lo largo de este ciclo de talleres participativos. Muchas de ellas refuerzan conocimientos previos y desafíos estratégicos en curso, como la formalización, la participación ciudadana y la innovación pública. Sin embargo, otras plantean nuevos retos en áreas clave como la educación, el ordenamiento territorial, la digitalización y el fortalecimiento de capacidades públicas. Estas cuestiones no sólo amplían nuestra perspectiva, sino que también delinean el camino para los próximos años de investigación y desarrollo en el PNUD Paraguay.

            ¿Cómo funcionó la fábrica de preguntas?A lo largo de cuatro talleres realizados los días 25 y 26 de noviembre de 2024, un total de 86 personas de distintos sectores—público, privado, académico, de cooperación y comunitario—participaron activamente, compartiendo análisis y perspectivas sobre los desafíos y preguntas de aprendizaje que nos plantea el futuro.Tomando como punto de partida a la comunidad de personas que nos han acompañado desde el año 2019 hasta la actualidad, diseñamos una metodología que promoviera espacios de conversación y conexión a través de cuatro talleres presenciales de reflexión colectiva sobre el desarrollo sostenible. Para guiar estas conversaciones, utilizamos cuatro murales ilustrados representativos sobre temas claves para el desarrollo: la gobernanza, el medio ambiente, la inclusión social y la proyección de futuro. Las ilustraciones representaban cada tema sin hacerlos explícitos textualmente.   
                  
            
    



           Mural       
            Inspirados por estas ilustraciones, cada participante formuló una o más preguntas relacionadas con el desarrollo de nuestro país, para luego trabajar en grupos sobre cada uno de los 4 temas claves, mejorando la redacción y estructura de sus preguntas con el apoyo de nuestra guía para formular preguntas de aprendizaje e investigación.  
       
            Al finalizar esta etapa, cada mesa temática exponía sus preguntas ajustadas en sus respectivos murales, y posteriormente se estableció un proceso de votación individual por parte de los participantes de las tres preguntas que consideraban más relevantes en términos de desarrollo del país.  
                 
            
    



        
            Además de generar un espacio de intercambio dinámico y constructivo, se buscó ofrecer un valor agregado a quienes dedicaron su tiempo a este proceso. Para ello, se sistematizaron algunas de las herramientas y metodologías más utilizadas por el AccLabPY que si bien ya habían sido compartidas en distintos blogs, en esta ocasión se presentaron en un formato más práctico y accesible a través de un mazo de cartas(link is external) vinculados a tableros digitales interactivos que permitan reutilizar las herramientas, permitiendo su aplicación directa por parte de los participantes. En total, se recopilaron 63 preguntas, las cuales fueron revisadas por el equipo de AccLabPY,  con base en los criterios de apropiación, impacto, factibilidad, potencial de aprendizaje, pertinencia, viabilidad y antecedentes, adicionalmente se tuvo en cuenta el esfuerzo institucional ya asumido por el PNUD y los recursos disponibles, para finalmente obtener una priorización de las preguntas y dimensiones que podrían guiar la agenda de aprendizaje del Laboratorio en los próximos años, utilizando la metodología de análisis multicriterio(link is external).   
                 
            
    



        
    
        
                        Nuevas Preguntas de AprendizajeLas preguntas propuestas por los participantes de los talleres y priorizadas de acuerdo a la metodología de evaluación multicriterio por el Laboratorio reflejan una visión integral y estratégica para abordar los desafíos nacionales. Estas preguntas no sólo identifican áreas críticas, sino que también proponen soluciones para mejorar la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos. Explorá las preguntas en nuestro dashboard de aprendizaje(link is external), que incluimos aquí abajo también para que no tengas que salir de este sitio.   
      
  
 
            La evaluación multicriterio(link is external) permitió a los miembros del Laboratorio identificar las preguntas más estratégicas y factibles, en el marco de cooperación que guía las actividades del PNUD en Paraguay. Estas preguntas seleccionadas fueron integradas en los ciclos de aprendizaje del AccLabPy, los cuales constituyen un proceso continuo de formulación de preguntas, experimentación y generación de conocimiento.    
                   
            
    



           Top 10 de preguntas mejor rankeadas     AccLabPY     
            Del análisis temático de las preguntas también surge un conjunto de temas o dimensiones fundamentales del desarrollo humano que nos permiten agrupar las preguntas de aprendizaje y señalar las grandes áreas de desafío que necesitamos atender:Equidad/Igualdad/Inclusión, Educación, Sostenibilidad y Desarrollo, Participación Ciudadana e Inteligencia Colectiva, Infraestructura y Servicios Públicos, Medioambiente y Energía, Capacidades y Gestión Institucional, Compras Públicas (Sostenibles), Tecnología y Desarrollo Local, Empleabilidad/Mipymes, Salud Pública, Ordenamiento Territorial, Espacios Públicos, Comunicación Publicitaria e Investigación e Innovación.   
                   
            
    



            Preguntas seleccionadas por ciclos de aprendizaje del AccLabPY     AccLabPY     
           Las principales preguntas en las dimensiones priorizadasLas preguntas identificadas en la dimensión de Equidad e Inclusión se centran en mejorar la conexión entre las necesidades de las comunidades vulnerables y las políticas públicas, visibilizar y abordar las desigualdades para ofrecer servicios en áreas de mayor necesidad, crear espacios accesibles para personas con discapacidad, fortalecer programas de capacitación laboral para mujeres vulnerables, y en integrar conocimientos y prácticas indígenas en el desarrollo sostenible.   
                   
            
    



            Preguntas sobre Equidad e Inclusión     AccLabPY     
           Se identificaron preguntas relativas a la dimensión de Educación que reflejan preocupaciones sobre cómo fomentar buenos hábitos financieros en los jóvenes, especialmente mujeres rurales, cómo integrar datos relacionados con el ODS 4 en programas universitarios, cómo lograr que todos los actores educativos se organizan para mejorar la calidad de la educación pública, cómo fortalecer programas para prevenir la deserción universitaria, y cómo fomentar la articulación entre gobiernos nacional y municipal para abordar problemáticas educativas. Estas consultas buscan mejorar la calidad y accesibilidad del sistema educativo en Paraguay.   
                   
            
    



            Preguntas sobre Educación     AccLabPY     
           En la dimensión de Participación Ciudadana e Inteligencia Colectiva se identificaron preguntas referentes a fomentar la colaboración activa entre el gobierno y la sociedad civil para impulsar el desarrollo sostenible y la implementación de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS). Existe interés en hallar formas de estimular la participación ciudadana en iniciativas locales que contribuyan a los ODS, promover la organización y participación de actores en la educación pública, cambiar hábitos para construir una ciudadanía activa, y garantizar el desarrollo local a través de la participación ciudadana. Además, explorar cómo construir ciudades inteligentes mediante políticas públicas inclusivas y participativas.

           Finalmente, en la dimensión de Capacidades y Gestión Institucional se identificaron preguntas que buscan fortalecer las capacidades técnicas y administrativas de los gobiernos municipales y departamentales en Paraguay. Estas consultas se centran en cómo desarrollar capacidades técnicas compartidas para la planificación urbana y territorial, evaluar las capacidades institucionales existentes para la planificación y operación de sistemas de transporte sustentables, y mejorar la ejecución y monitoreo de planes de ordenamiento territorial. Además, se exploran formas de utilizar la tecnología para mejorar servicios municipales, facilitar el acceso a datos para mejorar la planificación territorial, y desarrollar capacidades para medir y negociar el balance de carbono a nivel municipal. Estas consultas apuntan a mejorar la eficiencia y sostenibilidad de la gestión pública en diferentes ámbitos.

           Todas estas preguntas reflejan áreas críticas donde intervenciones efectivas pueden acelerar el logro del desarrollo sostenible en Paraguay. Emergen temas transversales que no sólo son relevantes desde una perspectiva nacional, sino también regional y global, conectando desafíos locales con agendas más amplias. Precisamente, esta es la tarea central del Laboratorio de Aceleración del PNUD en Paraguay (AccLabPY), cuyo propósito es generar conocimiento, experimentación y evidencia para acelerar el cumplimiento de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS).Reflexiones sobre el futuro del desarrollo sostenibleLas preguntas de aprendizaje son como los desafíos de desarrollo: continuos, emergentes e inagotables. Cuando una se responde, otra inicia, y abre un camino concatenado de causas y consecuencias de un mismo -o diferente- árbol de problemas, que nos encamina a una solución que es, a su vez, un nuevo problema / pregunta de partida. Y aunque todas las preguntas son igualmente válidas, es interesante observar, por ejemplo, como en el top 10 de preguntas emergen algunos de los grandes temas o desafíos que enfrentamos como país, en todos los niveles. El estado y su rol para impulsar el desarrollo desde sus procesos de compra pública emerge como un espacio estratégico para la promoción de la sostenibilidad económica, social y ambiental, que necesita, además, ofrecer estrategias para procurar innovación de distintos tipos en los proyectos y programas para el desarrollo del país.El desarrollo de las capacidades de los gobiernos, especialmente a nivel local, vinculado por un lado a la necesidad de mejorar la planificación urbana y territorial, y por el otro a la necesidad de incorporar cada vez más tecnología, datos y, en general, evidencia a las políticas públicas.La necesidad de vincular mejor las políticas públicas a las necesidades de las comunidades y a los esfuerzos para reducir la desigualdad y la pobreza, con una atención especial a la juventud y a las mujeres rurales.También es interesante pensar en los desafíos más grandes a los que cada pregunta señala bajo cada dimensión temática que surgió en este proceso. Como, por ejemplo, las preguntas de infraestructura nos señalan al desafío de mejorar los servicios públicos, especialmente de movilidad urbana. O cómo las preguntas de participación ciudadana apuntan al desafío de promover mayores capacidades de acción colectiva por parte de la ciudadanía: necesitamos aprender a participar por medio de nuestra acción.Por otro lado, los huecos y silencios son notables: ¿qué implica que no hayan surgido preguntas sobre transformación digital y tecnología emergente de manera más explícita?, ¿por qué surgieron tan pocas preguntas relacionadas a salud pública?. Las preguntas que no están hablan de comunidades con las que aún no hemos conectado, como laboratorio. Representan espacios en los que, ya sea por límites misionales de nuestra organización o por falta de recursos y tiempo, no hemos abordado aún preguntas de aprendizaje relevantes a los grupos que están resolviendo problemas y generando innovación desde su práctica. ¿Cuáles son las preguntas claves para nuestro desarrollo que no estamos haciendo?Desde el Laboratorio de Aceleración del PNUD en Paraguay, nos toca abordar algunas de estas preguntas en ciclos de aprendizaje que generen evidencia, conocimiento, y en general, nuevos recursos para enfrentar los desafíos señalados por estas preguntas. Responder todas las preguntas escapa a nuestras capacidades si trabajamos solos, pero tal vez en comunidad podamos responderlas entre todos, de a poco.

                                           Across the world, UNDP is engaged in taking on the toughest development challenges, helping countries fight poverty, responding to crises, and striving to build a better future. To do this effectively needs reliable funding. The most important funding is called ""core"" resources, provided mostly by member countries.  
               CORE         Core is a general fund – it's flexible, unlike money labeled for specific projects. This means UNDP can use such funding where it's needed most, whether that's quickly responding to a natural disaster, filling gaps in long-term development projects that aren't getting enough attention, or tackling unexpected challenges.      
            Here's why that flexibility matters:Helping the Poorest: A big chunk of core money goes directly to the world's poorest countries, focusing on those hardest to reach and most in need.Fast Crisis Response: When disaster strikes or conflict breaks out, core funds allow UNDP to act immediately, providing vital support in those crucial ‘make or break’ early moments.Attracting More Money: Core funding acts like smart investment. When UNDP can show it has a solid foundation with core money, this encourages other organizations, charities, and even businesses to pitch in with more specific funding, multiplying our work’s impact.Trying New Ideas: Core funding allows UNDP to experiment with innovative solutions to development challenges, like our ""Accelerator Labs"" that explore new approaches and solutions. It also supports important research, and reports that shape global thinking on development.Keeping Things Running Smoothly: This flexible money also underpins UNDP's global network of offices and staff, allowing them to provide on-the-ground support to governments and work efficiently within the broader UN system. It also ensures that we can maintain high standards, and be transparent and accountable in our work.UNDP's core resources have had a profound impact on development across Asia and the Pacific, and the world.Here are some of the stories funded by core resources:Stories

                                           Not long ago, the idea of Libya as a travel destination seemed like a distant dream. A country rich in history, culture, and natural beauty had long been overshadowed by years of conflict and isolation. But change is in the air. The narrow streets of Tripoli’s Old City are once again buzzing with life, motorsport enthusiasts are gathering in the Sahara, and—perhaps most tellingly—the world is starting to notice. With the recent launch of Libya’s e-visa system, the country is taking concrete steps to open its doors to international visitors. This signals a renewed commitment to welcoming the world and reclaiming Libya’s place on the global tourism map.From the cobbled alleys of Al-Madina to the golden dunes of the Great Sand Sea, Libya is slowly but surely stepping back onto the global tourism stage, driven by grassroots initiatives, a spirit of adventure, and an unexpected group of ambassadors—foreign social media influencers.

            A New Spotlight on Libya’s Heritage Libya has long been a crossroads of civilisations—Phoenicians, Romans, Byzantines, Ottomans, and Amazigh communities have all left their mark. Today, a renewed sense of pride in this heritage is taking root. The ongoing restoration of Tripoli’s Old City(link is external) is a symbol of this revival.  Once neglected, its whitewashed buildings, historic mosques, and vibrant souqs are now being carefully restored, turning the district into a cultural hub. Visitors can sip Libyan tea in the centuries-old courtyards or explore through artisan workshops nestled between stone walls.Cultural festivals are reactivating public spaces. Music spills from hidden courtyards. Local artists are painting new life into old walls. Landmarks like the Karamanly House Museum, once a crumbling relic, now stand proudly as a window into Libya’s past. This isn’t just about preserving history—it’s about making it part of everyday life again. International travel influencers also play a role through videos capturing the majesty of Sabratha’s seaside ruins(link is external). They are reaffirming the narrative. These stories are shifting perceptions, highlighting Libya not as a forgotten or fragile place but as a land of untapped adventure waiting to be explored.

            The Rise of Motorsport and Adventure Tourism Libya’s tourism revival isn’t only about reconnecting with the past—it’s also about new experiences.In the Sahara, adrenaline-fueled desert rallies are transforming Libya’s vast landscapes into international sporting arenas.  Events like the Ghadames Desert Rally(link is external) and the T-T Desert Rally(link is external) are attracting drivers from across North Africa, the Middle East, and even Europe. These rallies showcase Libya’s breathtaking dunes(link is external) and rugged terrain, proving that the country isn’t just a place of ancient wonders—it’s also a playground for the bold. For thousands of Libyan spectators, these events are more than just races; they are celebrations. They unite communities, ignite local economies, and spark renewed pride. The dynamic imagery shared on social media is also reshaping how Libya is seen by the world: as a destination for adventure, endurance, and connection.

            Making Travel Easy: The E-Visa One of the key barriers to tourism—visa access—is now being addressed.In 2024, Libya launched its e-visa system(link is external), streamlining what was once a lengthy and complicated process. Instead of navigating embassy bureaucracy or waiting months for approvals—now, travelers can apply online and receive their visa within days. In addition, Libya offers visa-free entry for 8 countries(link is external), further boosting accessibility for regional travellers. These efforts, paired with increased hospitality investments and infrastructure, these changes signal that Libya is open for tourism like never before.   
                  
            
    



             UNDP Libya /Malek Elmaghrebi     
            Looking Ahead: A New Chapter for Libyan Tourism As part of its support to economic diversification in Libya, UNDP has been working with the  Ministry of Economy to explore emerging sectors with growth potential. Among them, tourism stands out as a powerful opportunity for sustainable development and job creation. Using the Three Horizons strategic foresight approach, UNDP’s Accelerator Lab facilitated a collaborative process with government counterparts to envision the future of tourism in Libya.  Over the course of two months, the Lab introduced the methodology and trained Ministry teams on how to apply this method across various industries, including tourism, which emerged as a sector with significant potential for Libya’s future growth. This engagement culminated in the  “Café of Innovation and Ideas event: an interactive policy dialogue that brought together 65 participants from the government, private sector, academia, civil society organisations and youth leadership. In the tourism-focused session, participants mapped out Libya’s current tourism in Libya. Over the course of two months, the Lab introduced the methodology and trained Ministry teams on how to apply it across different sectors. Key challenges were acknowledged: limited infrastructure, outdated policies, and the need for greater security assurances.  However, the conversation quickly turned to opportunities. Ideas such as promoting Libya’s landscapes to filmmakers, developing tourism-focused mobile apps, and producing adventure tourism documentaries emerged as feasible next steps. The vision for the future was ambitious: A strong national tourism strategy. Skilled professionals. Public-private partnership. A compelling national narrative powered by digital platforms and media. Even medical tourism was flagged as a potential area for growth.    
           The momentum is building. What was once unthinkable is now becoming increasingly tangible. With each event hosted, influencer video shared, or traveller welcomed, Libya takes another step toward reintroducing itself to the world.

One thing became clear from the Café of Innovation and Ideas: Libya’s tourism potential is no longer a matter of “if”—but “when.”"

                                A couple of months ago, AccLab Turkey broached the concept of ghost space to to understand what it would take to design a truly participatory community project whereby a neglected public space is revitalized to create an inclusive and vibrant community hub through co-design. Although co-design methodology is very well known in urban design spheres globally, it has never been widely adopted in Turkey. AccLab Turkey contextualized this as a process of learning and sharing experience with the stakeholders.Ghost space is a term to describe underutilized or abandoned public spaces in an urban area. The primary cause of ghost spaces is poor design that lacks the attraction of place, safety, perceived safety, environmental quality, and accessibility. In some cases, ghost spaces are dilapidated but collectively memorized public areas which are deeply connected to the vivid narratives of people. However, today, ongoing political impositions and spatial interventions might serve to wipe away the collective understanding of what a public space is or should be in urban life.In its broadest definition, a public space is a place that is open and accessible to people. It encourages collectivism, action, demonstration, and creation of discourse via interaction. Indeed, it manifests the spirit of a city with its physical form and social fabric. By this mean, the placemaking practices supports creating dynamic, healthy urban environment, improves urban infrustructure, social networks, and safety when they are conducted with transparency and good faith from bottom up. The process requires strong local partnerships, participation of diverse existing groups and NGOs working collaboratively that results in enriching the value of identity, public demand, and recognition.AccLab Turkey aims to encourage exercising of rights to the city, diversity, and co-develop  constructive ground for communication between the municipality, citizens, and unusual actors.Today, the novel coronavirus has created a landscape of ghost areas; the term has expanded far beyond the landscape of an urban unit. It is spreading across the globe, city after city has shut down. As with natural disasters, epidemics deeply affect city governance, public morals and production of space. During the pandemic, most people are avoiding leaving their homes unless it is necessary. Emptiness in the built environment has spread vastly and we are witnessing the consequences of the fragility of our socioeconomic systems and urban planningDuring this period of isolation, it is not possible to study the place physically. In addition, the bureaucratic processes that are involved like signing an MoU with the municipality is on hold, which hampers progress. While this unexpected disruption is changing the dynamics of the project, it also creates new room to rethink public-ness and the future of urban public spaces.We have globally become aware of the virtues of resilience and cooperation. The pandemic has intensified discussions on eco-living, digital infrastructure, smart cities, internet technologies and the use of big data. We need to reconsider how as human beings we occupy the Earth to find new ways to improve environmental and social sustainability. If these new conditions persist, we will need to consider novel approaches to living and infrastructure, such as moving towards decentralized cities and redistributing some of the population to rural settlements thanks to today’s remote working capabilities.Among many other responses, actions and recovery scenarios, discussions about the future speculate about new terms of sociality - beyond the end of the pandemic, and what life might look like. One of the most important effects of the crisis is that we are still dependent on our temporal responsibilities, such as deadlines or meeting schedules, yet we are free, independent of the space.  The technological transformation expected in the next 10 years with Internet 3.0, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has also accelerated and brought up concepts such as the spatial internet on the agenda. So, the days when we will question spatiality are not far away.  We are all faced with an immersive need for digitalization in doing business, communication, and networking. Discovery of digital tools to maintain projects, meetings and programmes has become essential. Almost all communities and human relations have been moved to online platforms. Many art and science institutions have started sharing their archives online and have found ways to offer virtual access to their events and activities to stay connected.Even so, we can't technically claim those digital platforms as virtual public spaces, we don't pay much attention to the absence of public space online due to the ad-hoc nature of the internet: no zoning restrictions, no city plans or elected authorities. Yet they provide various tools to maintain some of the functions of public spaces such as participation, diversity, collective decision making, co-creation, and production of discourse.From this point of view, the ghost space project can still grow online in collaboration, participation and digital tools considering it as an experiment on its own. Online tools enable co-working, organization of events, workshops, and collective decision making. Therefore, we see a value-added opportunity in communicating via online platforms which permits the tracking of changing needs, perceptions, and futuristic perspectives through new living conditions. This enables us to understand the signals of new spatial organizations responding to the needs of possible future scenarios. The idea of rethinking how we occupy the Earth may fundamentally change how we design cities as well as the understanding of public spaces.The new normals have become embedded in our lives so suddenly, and how much we are exposed to this ambiguous process will also determine the future of cities as well. On the bright side, ambiguity invites solutions and has the power of transformation because of the natural human desire for certainty."

                                UNDP Hızlandırma Laboratuvarı Ocak 2020’de kent içindeki atıl kalmış bir kamusal alanın ortak tasarım yoluyla kapsayıcı ve farklı fonksiyonları barındıran bir kent müştereğine dönüşmesi konusunda çalışmaya başladı. Bu süreçte, hayalet mekanlar (Ghost Spaces) kavramından yola çıkarak, bu terk edilmiş mekanın topluluğa kazandırılması ve yeniden canlandırılması için katılımcı tasarım yöntemleri üzerine bir model geliştirdi. Ortak tasarım metodları, küresel ölçekte kentsel tasarım alanında yaygın olarak kullanılsa da Türkiye’deki örnekleri oldukça nadirdir. Bu bağlamda Hızlandırma Laboratuvarı atıl kalmış alanların kolektif ve katılımcı süreçlerle yeniden canlandırılması sürecini, başta yerel yönetimler olmak üzere çok sesli bir öğrenme deneyimi olarak kavramsallaştırdı.Hayalet mekan, kentteki atıl kalmış veya terkedilmiş alanları tanımlamak için kullanılan bir terimdir. Hayalet mekanların ortaya çıkmasındaki başlıca sebeplerinden bazıları bu mekanların tasarım, güvenlik, erişilebilirlik, çevresel kalite ve mekân kullanımı gibi özelliklerden yoksun olmasıdır. Bazı durumlarda ise bu mekanlar, yıkılmaya yüz tutmuş olmasına karşın insanların hikayelerine derinden bağlı olduklarından herkes tarafından bilinen ve hatırlanan yerlerdir. Bununla birlikte, günümüzde mevcut kent politikaları ve üst ölçekli kararlar sonucu yapılan mekânsal müdahaleler, kentsel yaşamda kamusal alanın ne olduğu ya da ne olması gerektiği konusundaki kolektif anlayışı yok etmeye yetebilir.En geniş anlamıyla, kamusal alan insanlar için erişilebilir olan açık ortak kullanım alanlarıdır. Etkileşim yoluyla kolektivizmi, eylemi, gösteriyi ve söylem yaratmayı teşvik eder. Gerçekten de, fiziksel yapısı ve sosyal dokusuyla bir kentin ruhunu ortaya koyar. Bu anlamda, mekânsal pratikler ve proje uygulama süreçleri baştan aşağı şeffaflık ve iyi niyet ile yürütüldüğünde dinamik ve sağlıklı bir kentsel çevre yaratmayı destekler; kentsel altyapıyı, sosyal ağları ve güvenliği geliştirir. Bu süreç kimliğin, kamu talebinin ve tanınmanın değerini artıracak olan güçlü yerel ortaklıklar ile çeşitli grupların ve iş birliği içinde çalışan STK'ların katılımını gerektiriyor.UNDP Türkiye Hızlandırma Laboratuvarı kent hakkı için belediye, vatandaşlar ve farklı aktörler arasındaki iletişim için yapıcı bir zemin geliştirmeyi amaçlıyor.Bugün, koronavirüs salgını, farklı ölçeklerde yeni hayalet mekanlar ve görünümler yarattı. Doğal afetlerde olduğu gibi, salgınlar da şehir yönetimini, genel ahlakı ve mekan üretimini de etkiledi. Yapılı çevrede azalan mobilite ile oluşan boşluk büyük çapta yayıldı ve buünlerde sosyoekonomik sistemlerimizin, kentsel politikalarımızın ve planlarımızın kırılganlığının sonuçlarına tanıklık ediyoruz..Karantina günlerinde, fiziksel mekanda çalışmak mümkün değil. Yerel yönetimler ile hali hazırda devam eden bürokratik süreçlerin, salgının yarattığı etki ile duraksamış olması süreci yavaşlatan etmenlerden biri. Bu beklenmedik aksama projenin dinamiklerini değiştirirken aynı zamanda kamusallığı ve kamusal alanların geleceğini yeniden düşünmek için yeni bir alan yaratıyor.Küresel olarak hepimiz dirençlilik ve iş birliğinin öneminin farkına vardık. Pandemi, ekolojik yaşam, dijital altyapı, akıllı şehirler, internet teknolojileri ve büyük verinin kullanımı gibi tartışmaları yoğunlaştırdı. Bununla birlikte, çevresel ve sosyal sürdürülebilirliği iyileştirmek için insanlar olarak dünyayı nasıl işgal ettiğimiz üzerine yeniden düşünmemiz gerekliliğini de ortaya koydu. Bu yeni koşullar devam ederse, günümüzün uzaktan çalışabilmeye elverişli araçlar sayesinde, merkezi olmayan şehirlere yönelmek ve nüfusun bir kısmını kırsal yerleşimlere yeniden dağıtmak gibi yaşam ve altyapıya yönelik yeni yaklaşımları dikkate almamız gerekebilir.Pandemi sürecinde yanıt, eylem ve kurtarma senaryoları arasında geleceğe ilişkin tartışmalar, pandemi sonrasında yaşamın nasıl olacağı, yeni sosyallik-kamusallık terimleri üzerinden de ilerliyor. Krizin en önemli etkilerinden biri, teslim tarihleri veya toplantı programları gibi zamansal sorumluluklarımıza hala bağımlı olduğumuzdur. Ancak yine de mekandan bağımsız olarak özgürüz. İnternet 3.0 ve Nesnelerin İnterneti (IoT) ile önümüzdeki 10 yılda beklenen teknolojik dönüşüm de hızlandı ve mekansal internet gibi kavramları gündeme getirdi. Yani, mekansallığı sorgulayacağımız günler çok uzak değil.Hepimiz çalışırken, iletişim kurarken ve yeni sosyal ağların parçası olurken kapsamlı bir dijitalleşme ihtiyacı ile karşı karşıyayız. Bu anlamda, projeleri, toplantıları ve programları sürdürmek için dijital araçların keşfi çok önemli hale geldi. Hemen hemen tüm topluluklar ve insan ilişkileri çevrimiçi platformlara taşındı. Pek çok sanat ve bilim kurumu arşivlerini çevrimiçi olarak paylaşmaya başladı ve bağlantılarını sürdürmek için etkinliklerine ve faaliyetlerine sanal erişim sunmanın yollarını buldu.  Yine de, bu dijital platformların teknik açıdan sanal kamusal alanlar olduğunu iddia edemeyiz. İnternetin ad-hoc doğası nedeniyle - imar kısıtlamaları, şehir planı veya seçilmiş yetkililer yok - çevrimiçi kamusal alan tartışmaları henüz toplumsal radarımıza girmedi. Ancak kamusal alanların katılım, çeşitlilik, toplu karar verme, birlikte yaratma ve söylem üretme gibi bazı işlevlerini sürdürmek için çeşitli araçlar sağlarlar.Bu açıdan, hayalet mekanlar projesi başlı başına bir deney olarak iş birliği, katılım ve dijital araçlarla hala çevrimiçi olarak büyüyebilir. Çevrimiçi araçlar birlikte çalışmaya, etkinlikler ve çalıştaylar organize edilmesine ve toplu karar almaya olanak sağlar. Bu nedenle, yeni yaşam koşullarıyla birlikte değişen ihtiyaçların, algıların ve fütüristtik perspektiflerin izlenmesine olanak veren çevrimiçi platformların aracılığıyla iletişimde bir katma değer fırsatı görüyoruz. Bu, gelecekteki olası senaryoların ihtiyaçlarına yanıt veren yeni mekansal organizasyonların sinyallerini anlamamızı sağlayacaktır. Dünyayı nasıl işgal ettiğimizi yeniden düşünme fikri, şehirleri nasıl tasarladığımızı ve kamusal alan anlayışımızı temelden değiştirebilir.Pandemi ile birlikte hayatımızı şekillendiren yeni normaller ve bu belirsiz sürece ne kadar maruz kaldığımız şehirlerin geleceğini de belirleyecektir. İyi yönden bakarsak, belirsizlik dönüştürücü çözümler için eşsiz bir fırsattır."

Japan SDGs Innovation Challenge


The Japan Cabinet Office (CAO), in partnership with the UNDP Japan Unit and UNDP Accelerator Labs, is supporting the SDGs Innovation Challenge to identify solutions to local development issues with the participation of the Japanese private sector.
The SDGs Innovation Challenge matches UNDP Accelerator Labs with Japanese companies in a new collaborative process where partners co-create solutions to address local needs.  Through the SDG Holistic Innovation Platform (SHIP), an open innovation platform run by UNDP in collaboration with the Japan Innovation Network (JIN), Japanese partners are identified, and this provides an entry point for companies that would typically not work with UNDP.  Both the Accelerator Labs and Japanese companies are identified through a selective process that grants $75,000 to the partnership.
A total of 7 UNDP Accelerator Labs are collaborating with Japanese companies to co-develop, design, and test models of potential solutions to problems identified in each country.  In 2020, an initial cohort of 4 Accelerator Labs was selected to work on global development issues across the SDGs, in close partnership with the Japanese private sector.  The winners are:UNDP India & NEC Corporation: Building a Fortress of Blockchain to Protect Farmers and Livelihoods

The UNDP Accelerator Lab in India, together with the Japanese company NEC Corporation, is developing a proof of concept for a blockchain platform for spices.

Based on the success of these projects, the Japan Cabinet Office renewed its support to these four countries to continue engagement with their respective Japanese partner.  Phase 2 grants total $40,000 per partnership.  In addition, the UNDP Accelerator Labs from South Africa, Burkina Faso, and Malaysia were selected as the second cohort of the Japan SDGs Innovation Challenge in 2021.  The areas they will address are food supply chains and disaster risk reduction. More information on these projects will be available here in 2022.
The SDGs innovation Challenge is made possible by an investment of $900,000 from the Japan Cabinet Office.  This joint initiative serves as a successful example of connecting technology and innovation from the private sector to different local contexts in developing countries to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs."

                            One of the major added values from UNDP’s Accelerator Labs(link is external) is exploration.
In my role as the Head of Exploration(link is external), my job is to continuously search for emerging, under-the-radar, and unique solutions. Explorers working for the Labs — like myself(link is external) — are expected to use methodologies such as horizon scanning, scenario planning or systems thinking, as well as look into alternative sources to gather data and market intelligence tools. Such tasks help us provide UNDP with an understanding of how global trends and cutting edge issues might potentially affect current policy and practices in the near future.
Let me walk you through how this is done in practice through a real-life example from our work at UNDP Colombia(link is external)’s Accelerator Lab. In Colombia, we have chosen to focus our work on vulnerable populations, because in our country there are many developmental gaps — what we call “hotspots”(link is external) — in terms of poverty, migration, gender inequality, violence.
How do you solve a problem like migration?
Since 2015, Colombia has attracted more than 1.6 million Venezuelan migrants, of which more than 50 percent are in irregular conditions or without proper documentation(link is external) (R4V, 2019). Experts say the trend of displacement is not going to change any time soon and that the majority of migrants will stay in Colombia for the long-term. This raises the questions of whether the country will be able to absorb this new population and whether it will be able to provide them with sustainable and secure livelihoods(link is external).
With our challenge defined, I set out on exploring how best to address migration. But how does one go about that? For me, exploring means taking a complex challenge like migration and approaching it in an open-ended way. It includes researching all related data and understanding how other countries have addressed this issue, so that we at the Accelerator Labs can apply what works to Colombia. Our theory of change is that, if we thoroughly understand a hotspot such as migration, we might be able to manage its effects and transform it into a development opportunity.How does “exploration” work?
We start with desk research, identifying relevant case studies, stakeholders and potential new data sources. The desk research helps us to identify patterns, unforeseen opportunities and collect under-the-radar insights around how to address a broad topic like migration. Some of these insights might not be obvious at first glance, or may run counterintuitive to our common understanding.
For example, in my exploration, I found that the most recurrent strategies are humanitarian and economic inclusion responses (providing access to basic services, shelter, employment, skills training, entrepreneurship programmes), perhaps because these issues are the easiest to observe and address for most programme specialists. But a counterintuitive insight may be that migration challenges also relate to migrants’ motivations and behaviors — for example, the desire of a migrant to feel free, to be recognized and to be culturally understood in a new country.
Additionally, mapping out case studies helps us to broaden our solutions spectrum by giving us new ideas on how to tackle migration using new technologies, changing narratives, and gathering unconventional data like emotional analysis from social media scraping.
Next step: Bringing insights together
We explorers are expected to use different yet complementary methods to make sense of counter-intuitive data.(link is external) Accordingly, I take the insights collected in my desk research with those obtained from systemic thinking and foresight exercises.On the one hand, the systemic thinking approach aims to provide learnings about the patterns, relations and mental models that exist within migration as a system. Migration is usually seen as a process of adaptation, but what happens if we start seeing it as a person’s right to freely choose to stay home or migrate to a new place of residence?
In this way, we analyze migration not just from diverse angles — political, social, economic and so on — but also from the viewpoints of diverse observers — urbanists, ethnographers, public officers, lawyers, migrants, host communities and development actors. This brings inclusivity to our insights but also adds value by bringing in new learnings and untraditional ways of thinking that we have not necessarily seen before.
At the same time, foresight exercises create possible futures starting with the identification of current trends or disruptive events that are related to migration and the exploration of direct and indirect implications of these events. For example, a global trend is that migration caused by climate change might be one of the biggest reasons why humans migrate in the near future. So, having a forward-thinking mindset can allow decision makers to take accurate actions in the present to positively affect future outcomes.
As you can see, we employ these various methods to be able to explore an emerging issue from multiple angles, which lead us to new — and often unexpected — findings.Beyond exploration: Completing our learning cycle
So what happens once the exploration phase is over? We combine the insights obtained from the research and systemic/foresight methods with the insights we get from the grassroot innovations mapped out by solutions mappers. For example, one of the recent insights we had is that it’s easier for migrants to establish themselves in a new country when they have an existing social network in Colombia rather than when they come by themselves, as that first contact allows them to navigate the territory and public services. Another insight is that migrants are being absorbed by the informal economy in Colombia. However, we identified that this insertion is more difficult for those migrants coming from the formal or public sector in Venezuela than for those with an entrepreneurial or informal background.
Once we have our insights from the sensing and exploring phases, we transform our findings into a hypothesis, which then become the basis of a portfolio of experiments to be tested hand in hand with UNDP’s country office and partners. For example, we recently conducted an experiment called “Augmented Development”(link is external). With this experiment we set out to identify and measure biases towards “otherness.” More specifically, our first measure was looking at the biases of urban populations towards left-behind hotspots and their inhabitants served by UNDP projects. In this augmented reality experience, each participant had access to 10 pictures, each one part of relevant UNDP initiatives. When a mobile device with the app was pointed at the photograph, a video popped up, telling the human story behind the project. Our aim is to run the experiment in other regions of Colombia and other targeted groups, to collect results and create new knowledge about behavioral science, the use of technology and reducing mental gaps as a path to reduce development gaps. Running experiments such as “Augmented Development”(link is external) allows us and our partners to succeed or fail fast and learn to scale multiple and integrated solutions in parallel from a systemic point-of-view.
Our learning journey has just started, so stay tuned to see the results that will follow."
